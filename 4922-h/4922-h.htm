    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON A STRANGE RANGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two tired but happy punchers rode into the coast town and dismounted in
      front of the best hotel. Putting up their horses as quickly as possible
      they made arrangements for sleeping quarters and then hastened out to
      attend to business. Buck had been kind to delegate this mission to them
      and they would feel free to enjoy what pleasures the town might afford.
      While at that time the city was not what it is now, nevertheless it was
      capable of satisfying what demands might be made upon it by two very
      active and zealous cow-punchers. Their first experience began as they left
      the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, you cow-wrastlers!&rdquo; said a not unpleasant voice, and they turned
      suspiciously as it continued: &ldquo;You've shore got to hang up them guns with
      the hotel clerk while you cavorts around on this range. This is <i>fence</i>
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They regarded the speaker's smiling face and twinkling eyes and laughed.
      &ldquo;Well, yo're the foreman if you owns that badge,&rdquo; grinned Hopalong,
      cheerfully. &ldquo;We don't need no guns, nohow, in this town, we don't. Plumb
      forgot we was toting them. But mebby you can tell us where lawyer Jeremiah
      T. Jones grazes in daylight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right over yonder, second floor,&rdquo; replied the marshal. &ldquo;An' come to think
      of it, mebby you better leave most of yore cash with the guns&mdash;somebody'll
      take it away from you if you don't. It'd be an awful temptation, an' flesh
      is weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; laughed Johnny, moving back into the hotel to leave his gun,
      closely followed by Hopalong. &ldquo;Anybody that can turn that little trick on
      me an' Hoppy will shore earn every red cent; why, we've been to Kansas
      City!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they emerged again Johnny slapped his pocket, from which sounded a
      musical jingling. &ldquo;If them weak people try anything on us, we may come
      between them and <i>their</i> money!&rdquo; he boasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the bottom of my heart I pity you,&rdquo; called the marshal, watching
      them depart, a broad smile illuminating his face. &ldquo;In about twenty-four
      hours they'll put up a holler for me to go git it back for 'em,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;An' I almost believe I'll do it, too. I ain't never seen none
      of that breed what ever left a town without empty pockets an' aching heads&mdash;an'
      the smarter they think they are the easier they fall.&rdquo; A fleeting
      expression of discontent clouded the smile, for the lure of the open range
      is hard to resist when once a man has ridden free under its sky and
      watched its stars. &ldquo;An' I wish I was one of 'em again,&rdquo; he muttered,
      sauntering on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah T. Jones, Esq., was busy when his door opened, but he leaned back
      in his chair and smiled pleasantly at their bow-legged entry, waving them
      towards two chairs. Hopalong hung his sombrero on a letter press and
      tipped his chair back against the wall; Johnny hung grimly to his hat, sat
      stiffly upright until he noticed his companion's pose, and then, deciding
      that everything was all right, and that Hopalong was better up in
      etiquette than himself, pitched his sombrero dexterously over the water
      pitcher and also leaned against the wall. Nobody could lose him when it
      came to doing the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, you look tired and thirsty. This is considered good for
      all human ailments of whatsoever nature, degree, or wheresoever located,
      in part or entirety, <i>ab initio</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Jones remarked, filling
      glasses. There was no argument and when the glasses were empty, he
      continued: &ldquo;Now what can I do for you? From the Bar-20? Ah, yes; I was
      expecting you. We'll get right at it,&rdquo; and they did. Half an hour later
      they emerged on the street, free to take in the town, or to have the town
      take them in,&mdash;which was usually the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that he said for us to keep away from?&rdquo; asked Johnny with keen
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Not so loud,&rdquo; chuckled Hopalong, winking prodigiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny pulled tentatively at his upper lip but before he could reply his
      companion had accosted a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, we're pilgrims in a strange land, an' we don't know the trails.
      Can you tell us where the docks are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; glad to. You'll find them at the end of this street,&rdquo; and he
      smilingly waved them towards the section of the town which Jeremiah T.
      Jones had specifically and earnestly warned them to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if you're as thirsty as me?&rdquo; solicitously inquired Hopalong of his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just wondering the same,&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he confided in a
      lower voice, &ldquo;blamed if I don't feel sort of lost without that Colt. Every
      time I lifts my right laig she goes too high&mdash;don't feel natural,
      nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here; I'm allus feeling to see if I lost it,&rdquo; Hopalong responded.
      &ldquo;There ain't no rubbing, no weight, nor nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I had something to put in its place, blamed if I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now yo're talking&mdash;mebby we can buy something,&rdquo; grinned
      Hopalong, happily. &ldquo;Here's a hardware store&mdash;come on in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk looked up and laid aside his novel. &ldquo;Good-morning, gentlemen;
      what can I do for you? We've just got in some fine new rifles,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customers exchanged looks and it was Hopalong who first found his
      voice. &ldquo;Nope, don't want no rifles,&rdquo; he replied, glancing around. &ldquo;To tell
      the truth, I don't know just what we do want, but we want something, all
      right&mdash;got to have it. It's a funny thing, come to think of it; I
      can't never pass a hardware store without going in an' buying something.
      I've been told my father was the same way, so I must inherit it. It's the
      same with my pardner, here, only he gets his weakness from his whole
      family, and it's different from mine. He can't pass a saloon without going
      in an' buying something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're a cheerful liar, an' you know it,&rdquo; retorted Johnny. &ldquo;You know the
      reason why I goes in saloons so much&mdash;you'd never leave 'em if I
      didn't drag you out. He inherits that weakness from his grandfather, twice
      removed,&rdquo; he confided to the astonished clerk, whose expression didn't
      know what to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see: a saw?&rdquo; soliloquized Hopalong. &ldquo;Nope; got lots of 'em, an'
      they're all genuine Colts,&rdquo; he mused thoughtfully. &ldquo;Axe? Nails? Augurs?
      Corkscrews? Can we use a corkscrew, Johnny? Ah, thought I'd wake you up.
      Now, what was it Cookie said for us to bring him? Bacon? Got any bacon?
      Too bad&mdash;oh, don't apologize; it's all right. Cold chisels&mdash;that's
      the thing if you ain't got no bacon. Let me see a three-pound cold chisel
      about as big as that,&rdquo;&mdash;extending a huge and crooked forefinger,&mdash;&ldquo;an'
      with a big bulge at one end. Straight in the middle, circling off into a
      three-cornered wavy edge on the other side. What? Look here! You can't
      tell us nothing about saloons that we don't know. I want a three-pound
      cold chisel, any kind, so it's cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny nudged him. &ldquo;How about them wedges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five cents a pound,&rdquo; explained the clerk, groping for his
      bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might do,&rdquo; Hopalong muttered, forcing the article mentioned into his
      holster. &ldquo;Why, they're quite hocus-pocus. You take the brother to mine,
      Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feels good, but I dunno,&rdquo; his companion muttered. &ldquo;Little wide at the
      sharp end. Hey, got any loose shot?&rdquo; he suddenly asked, whereat Hopalong
      beamed and the clerk gasped. It didn't seem to matter whether they bought
      bacon, cold chisels, wedges, or shot; yet they looked sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; what size?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three pounds of shot, I said!&rdquo; Johnny rumbled in his throat. &ldquo;Never mind
      what size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never care about size when we buy shot,&rdquo; Hopalong smiled. &ldquo;But,
      Johnny, wouldn't them little screws be better?&rdquo; he asked, pointing
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby; reckon we better get 'em mixed&mdash;half of each,&rdquo; Johnny gravely
      replied. &ldquo;Anyhow, there ain't much difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk had been behind that counter for four years, and executing and
      filling orders had become a habit with him; else he would have given them
      six pounds of cold chisels and corkscrews, mixed. His mouth was still open
      when he weighed out the screws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mix 'em! Mix 'em!&rdquo; roared Hopalong, and the stunned clerk complied, and
      charged them for the whole purchase at the rate set down for screws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong started to pour his purchase into the holster which, being open
      at the bottom, gayly passed the first instalment through to the floor. He
      stopped and looked appealingly at Johnny, and Johnny, in pain from holding
      back screams of laughter, looked at him indignantly. Then a guileless
      smile crept over Hopalong's face and he stopped the opening with a wad of
      wrapping paper and disposed of the shot and screws, Johnny following his
      laudable example. After haggling a moment over the bill they paid it and
      walked out, to the apparent joy of the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't laugh, Kid; you'll spoil it all,&rdquo; warned Hopalong, as he noted
      signs of distress on his companion's face. &ldquo;Now, then; what was it we said
      about thirst? Come on; I see one already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having entered the saloon and ordered, Hopalong beamed upon the bartender
      and shoved his glass back again. &ldquo;One more, kind stranger; it's good
      stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, feels like a shore-enough gun,&rdquo; remarked Johnny, combining two
      thoughts in one expression, which is brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bartender looked at him quickly and then stood quite still and
      listened, a puzzled expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tic&mdash;tickety-tick&mdash;tic-tic</i>, came strange sounds from the
      other side of the bar. Hopalong was intently studying a chromo on the wall
      and Johnny gazed vacantly out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that? What in the deuce is that?&rdquo; quickly demanded the man with
      the apron, swiftly reaching for his bung-starter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tickety-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic</i>, the noise went on, and Hopalong,
      slowly rolling his eyes, looked at the floor. A screw rebounded and struck
      his foot, while shot were rolling recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them's making the noise,&rdquo; Johnny explained after critical survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! I knowed we ought to 'a' got them wedges!&rdquo; Hopalong exclaimed,
      petulantly, closing the bottom of the sheath. &ldquo;Why, I won't have no gun
      left soon 'less I holds it in.&rdquo; The complaint was plaintive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be filtering through the stopper,&rdquo; Johnny remarked. &ldquo;But don't it
      sound nice, especially when it hits that brass cuspidor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender, grasping the mallet even more firmly, arose on his toes and
      peered over the bar, not quite sure of what he might discover. He had read
      of infernal machines although he had never seen one. &ldquo;What the blazes!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed in almost a whisper; and then his face went hard. &ldquo;You get out
      of here, quick! You've had too much already! I've seen drunks, but&mdash;G'wan!
      Get out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we ain't begun yet,&rdquo; Hopalong interposed hastily. &ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I see! I'd hate to see what you'll be seeing before long.
      God help you when you finish!&rdquo; rather impolitely interrupted the
      bartender. He waved the mallet and made for the end of the counter with no
      hesitancy and lots of purpose in his stride. &ldquo;G'wan, now! Get out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Johnny; I'd shoot him only we didn't put no powder with the
      shot,&rdquo; Hopalong remarked sadly, leading the way out of the saloon and
      towards the hardware store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better get out!&rdquo; shouted the man with the mallet, waving the weapon
      defiantly. &ldquo;An' don't you never come back again, neither,&rdquo; he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, it leaked,&rdquo; Hopalong said pleasantly as he closed the door of the
      hardware store behind him, whereupon the clerk jumped and reached for the
      sawed-off shotgun behind the counter. Sawed-off shotguns are great
      institutions for arguing at short range, almost as effective as dynamite
      in clearing away obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you come no nearer!&rdquo; he cried, white of face. &ldquo;You git out, or I'll
      let <i>this</i> leak, an' give you <i>all</i> shot, an' more than you can
      carry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy! Easy there, pardner; we want them wedges,&rdquo; Hopalong replied,
      somewhat hurriedly. &ldquo;The others ain't no good; I choked on the very first
      screw. Why, I wouldn't hurt you for the world,&rdquo; Hopalong assured him,
      gazing interestedly down the twin tunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny leaned over a nail keg and loosed the shot and screws into it,
      smiling with childlike simplicity as he listened to the tintinnabulation
      of the metal shower among the nails. &ldquo;It <i>does</i> drop when you let go
      of it,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you it would? I allus said so,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, looking
      back to the clerk and the shotgun. &ldquo;Didn't I, stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk's reply was a guttural rumbling, ninety per cent profanity, and
      Hopalong, nodding wisely, picked up two wedges. &ldquo;Johnny, here's yore gun.
      If this man will stop talking to hisself and drop that lead-sprayer long
      enough to take our good money, we'll wear em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed a gold coin on the table, and the clerk, still holding tightly
      to the shotgun, tossed the coin into the cash box and cautiously slid the
      change across the counter. Hopalong picked up the money and, emptying his
      holster into the nail keg, followed his companion to the street, in turn
      followed slowly by the suspicious clerk. The door slammed shut behind
      them, the bolt shot home, and the clerk sat down on a box and cogitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong hooked his arm through Johnny's and started down the street. &ldquo;I
      wonder what that feller thinks about us, anyhow. I'm glad Buck sent Red
      over to El Paso instead of us. Won't he be mad when we tell him all the
      fun we've had?&rdquo; he asked, grinning broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to meet Red at Dent's store on the way back and ride home
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were strangely clad for their surroundings, the chaps glaringly out
      of place in the Seaman's Port, and winks were exchanged by the regular <i>habitues</i>
      when the two punchers entered the room and called for drinks. They were
      very tired and a little under the weather, for they had made the most of
      their time and spent almost all of their money; but any one counting on
      robbing them would have found them sober enough to look out for
      themselves. Night had found them ready to go to the hotel, but on the way
      they felt that they must have one more bracer, and finish their
      exploration of Jeremiah T. Jones' tabooed section. The town had begun to
      grow wearisome and they were vastly relieved when they realized that the
      rising sun would see them in the saddle and homeward bound, headed for
      God's country, which was the only place for cow-punchers after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long way from the home port, ain't you, mates?&rdquo; queried a tar of
      Hopalong. Another seaman went to the bar to hold a short, whispered
      consultation with the bartender, who at first frowned and then finally
      nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too far from home, if that's what yo're driving at,&rdquo; Hopalong replied.
      &ldquo;Blast these hard trails&mdash;my feet are shore on the prod. Ever meet my
      side pardner? Johnny, here's a friend of mine, a salt-water puncher, an'
      he's welcome to the job, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny turned his head ponderously and nodded. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you,
      stranger. An' what'll you all have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Holland, mate,&rdquo; replied the other, joining them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All up!&rdquo; invited Hopalong, waving them forward. &ldquo;Might as well do things
      right or not at all. Them's my sentiments, which I holds as proper. Plain
      rye, general, if you means me,&rdquo; he replied to the bartender's look of
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drained the glass and then made a grimace. &ldquo;Tastes a little off&mdash;reckon
      it's my mouth; nothing tastes right in this cussed town. Now, up on our&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped and caught at the bar. &ldquo;Holy smoke! That's shore alcohol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny was relaxing and vainly trying to command his will power.
      &ldquo;Something's wrong; what's the matter?&rdquo; he muttered sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you meant beer; you ain't used to drinking whiskey,&rdquo; grinned the
      bartender, derisively, and watching him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&mdash;drink as much whiskey as&mdash;&rdquo; and, muttering, Johnny
      slipped to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn't whiskey!&rdquo; cried Hopalong, sleepily, &ldquo;that liquor was <i>fixed</i>!&rdquo;
       he shouted, sudden anger bracing him. &ldquo;An' I'm going to fix <i>you</i>,
      too!&rdquo; he added, reaching for his gun, and drawing forth a wedge. His
      sailor friend leaped at him, to go down like a log, and Hopalong, seething
      with rage, wheeled and threw the weapon at the man behind the bar, who
      also went down. The wedge, glancing from his skull, swept a row of bottles
      and glasses from the shelf and, caroming, went through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Hopalong was the vortex of a mass of struggling men and,
      handicapped as he was, fought valiantly, his rage for the time
      neutralizing the effects of the drug. But at last, too sleepy to stand or
      think, he, too, went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, that man's a fighter!&rdquo; enthusiastically remarked the leader,
      gently touching his swollen eye. &ldquo;George must 'a' put an awful dose in
      that grog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky for us he didn't have no gun&mdash;the wedge was bad enough,&rdquo;
       groaned a man on the floor, slowly sitting up. &ldquo;Whoever swapped him that
      wedge for his gun did us a good turn, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A companion tentatively readjusted his lip. &ldquo;I don't envy Wilkins his job
      breaking in that man when he gets awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't waste no time, mates,&rdquo; came the order. &ldquo;Up with 'em an' aboard.
      We've done our share; let the mate do his, an' be hanged. Hullo,
      Portsmouth; coming around, eh?&rdquo; he asked the man who had first felt the
      wedge. &ldquo;I was scared you was done for that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more shanghaiing hair pants for me, no more!&rdquo; thickly replied
      Portsmouth. &ldquo;Oh, my head, it's bust open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about the bartender&mdash;let him alone; we can't waste no
      time with him now!&rdquo; commanded the leader sharply. &ldquo;Get these fellers on
      board before we're caught with 'em. We want our money after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All clear!&rdquo; came a low call from the lookout at the door, and soon a
      shadowy mass surged across the street and along a wharf. There was a short
      pause as a boat emerged out of the gloom, some whispered orders, and then
      the squeaking of oars grew steadily fainter in the direction of a ship
      which lay indistinct in the darkness.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE REBOUND
    </h3>
    <p>
      A man moaned and stirred restlessly in a bunk, muttering incoherently. A
      stampeded herd was thundering over him, the grinding hoofs beating him
      slowly to death. He saw one mad steer stop and lower its head to gore him
      and just as the sharp horns touched his skin, he awakened. Slowly opening
      his bloodshot eyes he squinted about him, sick, weak, racking with pain
      where heavy shoes had struck him in the melee, his head reverberating with
      roars which seemed almost to split it open. Slowly he regained his full
      senses and began to make out his surroundings. He was in a bunk which
      moved up and down, from side to side, and was never still. There was a
      small, round window near his feet&mdash;thank heaven it was open, for he
      was almost suffocated by the foul air and the heat. Where was he? What had
      happened? Was there a salty odor in the air, or was he still dreaming?
      Painfully raising himself on one elbow he looked around and caught sight
      of a man in the bunk across. It was Johnny Nelson! Then, bit by bit, the
      whole thing came to him and he cursed heartily as he reviewed it and
      reached the only possible conclusion. He was at sea! He, Hopalong Cassidy,
      the best fighting unit of a good fighting outfit, shanghaied and at sea!
      Drugged, beaten, and stolen to labor on a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny was muttering and moaning and Hopalong slowly climbed out of the
      narrow bunk, unsteadily crossed the moving floor, and shook him. &ldquo;Reckon
      he's in a stampede, too!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;They shore raised h&mdash;l with
      us. Oh, what a beating we got! But we'll pass it along with trimmings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny's eyes opened and he looked around in confusion. &ldquo;Wha', Hopalong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's me, the prize idiot of a blamed good pair of 'em. How'd you
      feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleepy an' sick. My eyes ache an' my head's splitting. Where's Buck an'
      the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong sat down on the edge of the bunk and sore luridly, eloquently,
      beautifully, with a fervor and polish which left nothing to be desired in
      that line, and caused his companion to gaze at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a mighty bad dream, but you must 'a' had one a whole lot worse, to
      listen to you,&rdquo; Johnny remarked. &ldquo;Gee, you're going some! What's the
      matter with you. You sick, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Hopalong unfolded the tale of woe and when Johnny had grasped
      its import and knew that his dream had been a stern reality, he
      straightway loosed his vocabulary and earned a draw. &ldquo;Well, I'm going back
      again,&rdquo; he finished, with great decision, arising to make good his
      assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swim or walk?&rdquo; asked Hopalong nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Oh, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't going to either swim or walk,&rdquo; Hopalong soliloquized. &ldquo;I'm
      just going to stay right here in this one-by-nothing cellar an' spoil the
      health an' good looks of any pirate that comes down that ladder to get me
      out.&rdquo; He looked around, interested in life once more, and his trained eye
      grasped the strategic worth of their position. &ldquo;Only one at a time, an'
      down that ladder,&rdquo; he mused, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Why, Johnny, we owns this
      range as long as we wants to. They can't get us out. But, say, if only we
      had our guns!&rdquo; he sighed, regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right as far as you go; but you don't go to the eating part. We'll
      starve, an' we ain't got no water. I can drink about a bucketful right
      now,&rdquo; moodily replied his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yo're right; but mebby we can find food an' water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't see no signs of none. Hey!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, smiling faintly in
      his misery. &ldquo;Let's get busy an' burn the cussed thing up! Got any
      matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First you want to drown yoreself swimming, an' now you want to roast the
      pair of us to death,&rdquo; Hopalong retorted, eyeing the rear wall of the room.
      &ldquo;Wonder what's on the other side of that partition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny looked. &ldquo;Why, water; an' lots of it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw; the water is on the other sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do I know?&mdash;sh! I hear somebody coming on the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tumble back in yore bunk&mdash;quick!&rdquo; Hopalong hurriedly whispered. &ldquo;Be
      asleep&mdash;if he comes down here it'll be our deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steps overhead stopped at the companionway and a shadow appeared
      across the small patch of sunlight on the floor of the forecastle. &ldquo;Tumble
      up here, you blasted loafers!&rdquo; roared a deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply came from the forecastle&mdash;the silence was unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have to come down there I'll&mdash;&rdquo; the first mate made promises in
      no uncertain tones and in very impolite language. He listened for a
      moment, and having very good ears and hearing nothing, made more promises
      and came down the ladder quickly and nimbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I'll</i> bring you to,&rdquo; he muttered, reaching a brawny hand for
      Hopalong's nose, and missing. But he made contact with his own face, which
      stopped a short-arm blow from the owner of the aforesaid nose, a jolt full
      of enthusiasm and purpose. Beautiful and dazzling flashes of fire filled
      the air and just then something landed behind his ear and prolonged the
      pyrotechnic display. When the skyrockets went up he lost interest in the
      proceedings and dropped to the floor like a bag of meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong cut another piece from the rope in his hand and watched his
      companion's busy fingers. &ldquo;Tie him good, Johnny; he's the only ace we've
      drawn in this game so far, an' we mustn't lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny tied an extra knot for luck and leaned forward, his eyes riveted on
      the bump under the victim's coat. His darting hand brought into sight that
      which pleased him greatly. &ldquo;Oh, joy! Here, Hoppy; you take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong turned the weapon over in his hand, spun the cylinder and
      gloated, the clicking sweet music to his ears. &ldquo;Plumb full, too! I never
      reckoned I'd ever be so tickled over a snub-nosed gun like this&mdash;but
      I feel like singing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I feel like dying,&rdquo; grunted Johnny, grabbing at his stomach. &ldquo;If the
      blamed shack would only stand still!&rdquo; he groaned, gazing at the floor with
      strong disgust. &ldquo;I don't reckon I've ever been so blamed sick in all my&mdash;&rdquo;
       the sentence was unfinished, for the open porthole caught his eye and he
      leaped forward to use it for a collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong gazed at him in astonishment and sudden pity took possession of
      him as his pallid companion left the porthole and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have something to eat, Kid&mdash;I'm purty hungry myself&mdash;what
      the blazes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, for Johnny's protesting wail was finished
      outside the port. Then a light broke upon him and he wondered how soon it
      would be his turn to pay tribute to Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilkins!&rdquo; shouted a voice from the deck, and Hopalong moved back a
      step. &ldquo;Mr. Wilkins!&rdquo; After a short silence the voice soliloquized: &ldquo;Guess
      he changed his mind about it; I'll get 'em up for him,&rdquo; and feet came into
      view. When halfway down the ladder the second mate turned his head and
      looked blankly down a gun barrel while a quiet but angry voice urged him
      further: &ldquo;Keep a-coming, keep a-coming!&rdquo; The second mate complained, but
      complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick 'em up higher&mdash;now, Johnny, wobble around behind the nice man
      an' take <i>his</i> gun&mdash;you shut yore yap! I'm bossing this trick,
      not you. Got it, Kid? There's the rope&mdash;that's right. Nobody'd think
      you sick to see you work. Well, that's a good draw; but it's only a pair
      of aces against a full, at that. Wonder who'll be the next. Hope it's the
      foreman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny, keeping up by sheer grit, pointed to the rear wall. &ldquo;What about
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply his companion walked over to it, put his shoulder to it and
      pushed. He stepped back and hurled his weight against it, but it was firm
      despite its squeaking protest. Then he examined it foot by foot and found
      a large knot, which he drove in by a blow of the gun. Bending, he squinted
      through the opening for a full minute and then reported:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purty black in there at this end, but up at the other there's a light
      from a hole in the roof, an' I could see boxes an' things like that. I
      reckon it's the main cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could get out at the other end with that gun you've got we could
      raise blazes for a while,&rdquo; suggested Johnny. &ldquo;Anyhow, mebby they can come
      at us that way when they find out what we've gone an' done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're right,&rdquo; Hopalong replied, looking around. Seeing an iron bar he
      procured it and, pushing it through the knot hole in the partition,
      pulled. The board, splitting and cracking under the attack, finally broke
      from its fastenings with a sharp report, and Hopalong, pulling it aside,
      stepped out of sight of his companion. Johnny was grinning at the success
      of his plan when he was interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy, down there!&rdquo; yelled a stentorian voice from above. &ldquo;Mr. Wilkins!
      What the devil are you doing so long?&rdquo; and after a very short wait other
      feet came into sight. Just then the second mate, having managed to slip
      off the gag, shouted warning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Captain! They've got us and our guns! One of them has&mdash;&rdquo;
       but Johnny's knee thudded into his chest and ended the sentence as a
      bullet sent a splinter flying from under the captain's foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang these guns!&rdquo; Johnny swore, and quickly turned to secure the gag in
      the mouth of the offending second mate. &ldquo;You make any more yaps like that
      an' I'll wing you for keeps with yore own gun!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;We're caught
      in yore trap an' we'll fight to a finish. You'll be the first to go under
      if you gets any smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy, men!&rdquo; roared the captain in a towering rage, dancing frantically
      about on the deck and shouting for the crew to join him. He filled the air
      with picturesque profanity and stamped and yelled in passion at such rank
      mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand grenades! Hand grenades!&rdquo; he cried. Then he remembered that his two
      mates were also below and would share in the mutineers' fate, and his rage
      increased at his galling helplessness. When he had calmed sufficiently to
      think clearly he realized that it was certain death for any one to attempt
      going down the ladder, and that his must be a waiting game. He glanced at
      his crew, thirteen good men, all armed with windlass bars and belaying
      pins, and gave them orders. Two were to watch the hatch and break the
      first head to appear, while the others returned to work. Hunger and thirst
      would do the rest. And what joy would be his when they were forced to
      surrender!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong groped his way slowly towards the patch of light, barking his
      shins, stumbling and falling over the barrels and crates and finally,
      losing his footing at a critical moment, tumbled down upon a box marked
      &ldquo;Cotton.&rdquo; There was a splintering crash and the very faint clink of metal.
      Dazed and bruised, he sat up and felt of himself&mdash;and found that he
      had lost his gun in the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where in blazes did it fly to?&rdquo; he muttered angrily, peering about
      anxiously. His eyes suddenly opened their widest and he stared in surprise
      at a field gun which covered him; and then he saw parts of two more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Is this a gunboat?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are we up against bluejackets
      an' Uncle Sam?&rdquo; He glanced quickly back the way he had come when he heard
      Johnny's shot, but he could see nothing. He figured that Johnny had sense
      enough to call for help if he needed it, and put that possibility out of
      his mind. &ldquo;Naw, this ain't no gunboat&mdash;the Government don't steal
      men; it enlists 'em. But it's a funny pile of junk, all the same. Where in
      blazes is that toy gun? <i>Well</i>, I'll be hanged!&rdquo; and he plunged
      toward the &ldquo;Cotton&rdquo; box he had burst in his descent, and worked at it
      frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winchesters! Winchesters!&rdquo; he cried, dragging out two of them. &ldquo;Whoop!
      Now for the cartridges&mdash;there shore must be some to go with these
      guns!&rdquo; He saw a keg marked &ldquo;Nails,&rdquo; and managed to open it after great
      labor&mdash;and found it full of army Colts. Forcing down the desire to
      turn a handspring, he slipped one of the six-shooters in his empty holster
      and patted it lovingly. &ldquo;Old friend, I'm shore glad to see you, all right.
      You've been used, but that don't make no difference.&rdquo; Searching further,
      he opened a full box of <i>machetes</i>, and soon after found cartridges
      of many kinds and calibres. It took him but a few minutes to make his
      selection and cram his pockets with them. Then he filled two Colts and two
      Winchesters&mdash;and executed a short jig to work off the dangerous
      pressure of his exuberance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what an unholy lot of weapons,&rdquo; he soliloquized on his way back to
      Johnny. &ldquo;An' they're all second-hand. Cannons, too&mdash;an' <i>machetes</i>!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, suddenly understanding. &ldquo;Jumping Jerusalem!&mdash;a
      filibustering expedition bound for Cuba, or one of them wildcat republics
      down south! Oh, ho, my friends; I see where you have bit off more'n you
      can chew.&rdquo; In his haste to impart the joyous news to his companion, he
      barked his shins shamefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Way down south in the land o' cotton, cinnamon seed an''&mdash;whoa,
      blast you!&rdquo; and Hopalong stuck his head through the opening in the
      partition and grinned. &ldquo;Heard you shoot, Kid; I reckoned you might need me&mdash;an'
      these!&rdquo; he finished, looking fondly upon the weapons as he shoved them
      into the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny groaned and held his stomach, but his eyes lighted up when he saw
      the guns, and he eagerly took one of each kind, a faint smile wreathing
      his lips. &ldquo;Now we'll show these water snakes what kind of men they stole,&rdquo;
       he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up on the deck the choleric captain still stamped and swore, and his crew,
      with well-concealed mirth, went about their various duties as if they were
      accustomed to have shanghaied men act this way. They sympathized with the
      unfortunate pair, realizing how they themselves would feel if shanghaied
      to break broncos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan, A. B., stated the feelings of his companions very well in his
      remarks to the men who worked alongside: &ldquo;In me hear-rt I'm dommed glad av
      it, Yensen. I hope they bate the old man at his own game. 'T is a shame in
      these days for honest men to be took in that unlawful way. I've heard me
      father tell of the press gangs on the other side, an' 't is small
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yensen looked up to reply, chanced to glance aft, and dropped his calking
      iron in his astonishment. &ldquo;Yumping Yimminy! Luk at dat fallar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogan looked. &ldquo;The deuce! That's a man after me own heat-rt! Kape yore
      pagan mouth shut! If ye take a hand agin 'em I'll swab up the deck wid
      yez. G'wan wor-rking like a sane man, ye ijit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay ent ban fight wit dat fallar! Luk at the gun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man had climbed out of the after hatch and was walking rapidly towards
      them, a rifle in his hands, while at his thigh swung a Colt. He watched
      the two seamen closely and caught sight of Hogan's twinkling blue eyes,
      and a smile quivered about his mouth. Hogan shut and opened one eye and
      went on working.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Hopalong caught sight of the captain, the rifle went up and he
      announced his presence without loss of time. &ldquo;Throw up yore hands, you
      pole-cat! I'm running this ranch from now on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain wheeled with a jerk and his mouth opened, and then clicked
      shut as he started forward, his rage acting galvanically. But he stopped
      quickly enough when he looked down the barrel of the Winchester and glared
      at the cool man behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the blank are you doing?&rdquo; he yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't kidnapping cow-punchers to steal my boat,&rdquo; replied
      Hopalong. &ldquo;An' you fellers stand still or I'll drop you cold!&rdquo; he ordered
      to the assembled and restless crew. &ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; he shouted, and his
      companion popped up through the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. &ldquo;Good boy,
      Johnny. Tie this coyote foreman like you did the others,&rdquo; he ordered.
      While Johnny obeyed, Hopalong looked around the circle, and his eyes
      rested on Hogan's face, studying it, and found something there which
      warmed his heart. &ldquo;Friend, do you know the back trail? Can you find that
      runt of a town we left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore, you; who'd you think I was talking to? Can you find the way back,
      the way we came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure an' I can that, if I'm made to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll swing for mutiny if you do, you bilge-wallering pirate!&rdquo; roared
      the trussed captain. &ldquo;Take that gun away from him, d'ye hear!&rdquo; he yelled
      at the crew. &ldquo;I'm captain of this ship, an' I'll hang every last one of
      you if you don't obey orders! This is mutiny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't do no hanging with that load of weapons below!&rdquo; retorted
      Hopalong. &ldquo;Uncle Sam is looking for filibusters&mdash;this here gun is
      'cotton,'&rdquo; he said, grinning. He turned to the crew. &ldquo;But you fellers are
      due to get shot if you sees her through,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm captain of this ship&mdash;&rdquo; began the helpless autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shore look like it, all right,&rdquo; Hopalong replied, smiling. &ldquo;If yo're
      the captain you order her turned around and headed over the back trail, or
      I'll drop you overboard off yore own ship!&rdquo; Then fierce anger at the
      thought of the indignities and injuries he and his companion had suffered
      swept over him and prompted a one-minute speech which left no doubt as to
      what he would do if his demand was not complied with. Johnny, now free to
      watch the crew, added a word or two of endorsement, and he acted a little
      as if he rather hoped it would not be complied with: he itched for an
      excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain did some quick thinking; the true situation could not be
      disguised, and with a final oath of rage he gave in. &ldquo;'Bout ship, Hogan;
      nor' by nor'west,&rdquo; he growled, and the seaman started away to execute the
      command, but was quickly stopped by Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogan, is that right?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;No funny business, or we'll clean up
      the whole bunch, an' blamed quick, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the course, sor. That's the way back to town. I can navigate, an'
      me orders are plain. Ye're Irish, by the way av ye, and 't is back to town
      ye go, sor!&rdquo; He turned to the crew: &ldquo;Stand by, me boys.&rdquo; And in a short
      time the course was nor' by nor'west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return journey was uneventful and at nightfall the ship lay at anchor
      off the low Texas coast, and a boat loaded with men grounded on the sandy
      beach. Four of them arose and leaped out into the mild surf and dragged
      the boat as high up on the sand as it would go. Then the two cow-punchers
      followed and one of them gave a low-spoken order to the Irishman at his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sor,&rdquo; replied Hogan, and hastened to help the captain out onto the
      sand and to cut the ropes which bound him. &ldquo;Do ye want the mates, too,
      sor?&rdquo; he asked, glancing at the trussed men in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the foreman's enough,&rdquo; Hopalong responded, handing his weapons to
      Johnny and turning to face the captain, who was looking into Johnny's gun
      as he rubbed his arms to restore perfect circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you flat-faced coyote, yo're going to get the beating of yore life,
      an' I'm going to give it to you!&rdquo; Hopalong cried, warily advancing upon
      the man whom he held to be responsible for the miseries of the past
      twenty-four hours. &ldquo;You didn't give me a square deal, but I'm man enough
      to give you one! When you drug an' steal any more cow-punchers&mdash;&rdquo;
       action stopped his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great fight. A filibustering sea captain is no more peaceful than
      a wild boar and about as dangerous; and while this one was not at his
      best, neither was Hopalong. The latter luckily had acquired some knowledge
      of the rudiments of the game and had the vigor of youth to oppose to the
      captain's experience and his infuriated but well-timed rushes. The seamen,
      for the honor of their calling and perhaps with a mind to the future,
      cheered on the captain and danced up and down in their delight and
      excitement. They had a lot of respect for the prowess of their master, and
      for the man who could stand up against him in a fair and square fist
      fight. To give assistance to either in a fair fight was not to be thought
      of, and Johnny's gun was sufficient after-excuse for non-interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>sop! sop!</i> of the punishing blows as they got home and the
      steady circling of Hopalong in avoiding the dangerous attacks, went on
      minute after minute. Slowly the captain's strength was giving out, and he
      resorted to trickery as his last chance. Retreating, he half raised his
      arms and lowered them as if weary, ready as a cat to strike with all his
      weight if the other gave an opening. It ought to have worked&mdash;it had
      worked before&mdash;but Hopalong was there to win, and without the
      momentary hesitation of the suspicious fighter he followed the retreat and
      his hard hand flashed in over the captain's guard a fraction of a second
      sooner than that surprised gentleman anticipated. The ferocious frown gave
      way to placid peace and the captain reclined at the feet of the battered
      victor, who stood waiting for him to get up and fight. The captain lay
      without a sign of movement and as Hopalong wondered, Hogan was the first
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fer the love av hiven, let him be! Ye needn't wait&mdash;he's done; I
      know by the sound av it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, stepping forward. &ldquo;'T was a purty
      blow, an' 't was a gr-rand foight ye put up, sor! A gr-rand foight, but
      any more av that is murder! 'T is an Irishman's game, sor, an' ye did
      yersilf proud. But now let him be&mdash;no man, least av all a Dootchman,
      iver tuk more than that an' lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong looked at him and slowly replied between swollen lips, &ldquo;Yo're
      right, Hogan; we're square now, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, sor,&rdquo; Hogan replied, and turned to his companions. &ldquo;Put him
      in the boat; an' mind ye handle him gintly&mdash;we'll be sailing under
      him soon. Now, sor, if it's yer pleasure, I'll be after saying good-bye to
      ye, sor; an' to ye, too,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands with both punches. &ldquo;Fer a
      sick la-ad ye're a wonder, ye are that,&rdquo; he smiled at Johnny, &ldquo;but ye want
      to kape away from the water fronts. Good-bye to ye both, an' a pleasant
      journey home. The town is tin miles to me right, over beyant them hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Hogan,&rdquo; mumbled Hopalong gratefully. &ldquo;Yo're square all the way
      through; an' if you ever get out of a job or in any kind of trouble that I
      can help you out of, come up to the Bar-20 an' you won't have to ask
      twice. Good luck!&rdquo; And the two sore and aching punchers, wiser in the ways
      of the world, plodded doggedly towards the town, ten miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning found them in the saddle, bound for Dent's hotel and
      store near the San Miguel Canyon. When they arrived at their destination
      and Johnny found there was some hours to wait for Red, his restlessness
      sent him roaming about the country, not so much &ldquo;seeking what he might
      devour&rdquo; as hoping something might seek to devour him. He was so sore over
      his recent kidnapping that he longed to find a salve. He faithfully
      promised Hopalong that he would return at noon.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DICK MARTIN STARTS SOMETHING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dick Martin slowly turned, leaned his back against the bar, and languidly
      regarded a group of Mexicans at the other end of the room. Singly, or in
      combinations of two or more, each was imparting all he knew, or thought he
      knew about the ghost of San Miguel Canyon. Their fellow-countryman, new to
      the locality, seemed properly impressed. That it was the ghost of Carlos
      Martinez, murdered nearly one hundred years before at the big bend in the
      canyon, was conceded by all; but there was a dispute as to why it showed
      itself only on Friday nights, and why it was never seen by any but a
      Mexican. Never had a Gringo seen it. The Mexican stranger was appealed to:
      Did this not prove that the murder had been committed by a Mexican? The
      stranger affected to consider the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin surveyed them with outward impassiveness and inward contempt. A
      realist, a cynic, and an absolute genius with a Colt .45, he was well
      known along the border for his dare-devil exploits and reckless courage.
      The brainiest men in the Secret Service, Lewis, Thomas, Sayre, and even
      old Jim Lane, the local chief, whose fingers at El Paso felt every
      vibration along the Rio Grande, were not as well known&mdash;except to
      those who had seen the inside of Government penitentiaries&mdash;and they
      were quite satisfied to be so eclipsed. But the Service knew of the ghost,
      as it knew everything pertaining to the border, and gave it no serious
      thought; if it took interest in all the ghosts and superstitions peculiar
      to the Mexican temperament it would have no time for serious work. Martin
      once, in a spirit of savage denial, had wasted the better part of several
      successive Friday nights in the San Miguel, but to no avail. When told
      that the ghost showed itself only to Mexicans he had shrugged his
      shoulders eloquently and laughed, also eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Greaser,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is one-half fear and superstition, an' the other
      half imagination. There ain't no ghosts, but I know the <i>Greasers</i>
      have seen 'em, all right. A Greaser can see anything scary if he makes up
      his mind to. If <i>I</i> ever see one an' he keeps on being one after I
      shoot, I'll either believe in ghosts, or quit drinking.&rdquo; His eyes twinkled
      as he added: &ldquo;An' of the two, I think I'd <i>prefer</i> to see ghosts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was flushed and restless with deviltry. His fifth glass always made him
      so; and to-night there was an added stimulus. He believed the strange
      Mexican to be Juan Alvarez, who was so clever that the Government had
      never been able to convict him. Alvarez was fearless to recklessness and
      Martin, eager to test him, addressed the group with the blunt terseness
      for which he was famed, and hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greasers are cowards,&rdquo; he asserted quietly, and with a smile which
      invited excitement. He took a keen delight in analyzing the expressions on
      the faces of those hit. It was one of his favorite pastimes when feeling
      coltish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group was shocked into silence, quickly followed by great unrest and
      hot, muttered words. Martin did not move a muscle, the smile was set, but
      between the half-closed eyelids crouched Combat, on its toes. The Mexicans
      knew it was there without looking for it&mdash;the tone of his voice, the
      caressing purr of his words, and his unnatural languor were signs well
      known to them. Not a criminal sneaking back from voluntary banishment in
      Mexico who had seen those signs ever forgot them, if he lived. Martin
      watched the group cat-like, keenly scrutinizing each face, reading the
      changing emotions in every shifting expression; he had this art down so
      well that he could tell when a man was debating the pull of a gun, and
      beat him on the draw by a fraction of a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De senor ees meestak,&rdquo; came the reply, as quiet and caressing as the
      words which provoked it. The strange Mexican was standing proudly and
      looking into the squinting eyes with only a grayness of face and a
      tigerish litheness to tell what he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None go through the canyon after dark on Fridays,&rdquo; purred Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> go tro' de canyon nex' Friday night. Eef I do, then you mak
      apology to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll limit my remark to all but one Greaser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mexican stepped forward. &ldquo;I tak' thees gloove an' leave eet at de Beeg
      Ben', for you to fin' in daylight,&rdquo; he said, tapping one of Martin's
      gauntlets which lay on the bar. &ldquo;You geev' me eet befo' I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; at nine o'clock to-morrow night,&rdquo; Martin replied, hiding his
      elation. He was sure that he knew the man now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mexican, cool and smiling, bowed and left the room, his companions
      hastening after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll bet twenty-five dollars he flunks!&rdquo; breathed the bartender,
      straightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin turned languidly and smiled at him. &ldquo;I'll take that, Charley,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Nelson was always late, and on this occasion he was later than
      usual. He was to have joined Hopalong and Red, if Red had arrived, at
      Dent's at noon the day before, and now it was after nine o'clock at night
      as he rode through San Felippe without pausing and struck east for the
      canyon. The dropping trail down the canyon was serious enough in broad
      daylight, but at night to attempt its passage was foolhardy, unless one
      knew every turn and slant by heart, which Johnny did not. He was
      thirty-three hours late now, and he was determined to make up what he
      could in the next three.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Johnny left Hopalong at Dent's he had given his word to be back on
      time and not to keep his companions waiting, for Red might be on time and
      he would chafe if he were delayed. But, alas for Johnny's good intentions,
      his course took him through a small Mexican hamlet in which lived a
      senorita of remarkable beauty and rebellious eyes; and Johnny tarried in
      the town most of the day, riding up and down the streets, practising the
      nice things he would say if he met her. She watched him from the heavily
      draped window, and sighed as she wondered if her dashing Americano would
      storm the house and carry her off like the knights of old. Finally he had
      to turn away with heavy and reluctant heart, promising himself that he
      would return when no petulant and sarcastic companions were waiting for
      him. Then&mdash;ah! what dreams youth knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour ahead of him on another trail rode Juan, smiling with
      satisfaction. He had come to San Felippe to get a look at the canyon on
      Friday nights, and Martin had given him an excuse entirely unexpected. For
      this he was truly grateful, even while he knew that the American had tried
      to pick a quarrel with him and thus rid the border of a man entirely too
      clever for the good of customs receipts; and failing in that, had hoped
      the treacherous canyon trail would gain that end in another manner. Old
      Jim Lane's fingers touched wires not one whit more sensitive than those
      which had sent Juan Alvarez to look over the San Miguel&mdash;and Lane's
      wires had been slow this time. When Juan had left the saloon the night
      before and had seen Manuel slip away from the group and ride off into the
      north, he had known that the ghost would show itself the following night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Juan was to be disappointed. He was still some distance from the
      canyon when a snarling bulk landed on the haunches of his horse. He jerked
      loose his gun and fired twice and then knew nothing. When he opened his
      eyes he lay quietly, trying to figure it out with a head throbbing with
      pain from his fall. The cougar must have been desperate for food to attack
      a man. He moved his foot and struck something soft and heavy. His shots
      had been lucky, but they had not saved him his horse and a sprained arm
      and leg. There would be no gauntlet found at the Big Bend at daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Johnny Nelson reached the twin boulders marking the beginning of the
      sloping run where the trail pitched down, he grinned happily at sight of
      the moon rising over the low hills and then grabbed at his holster, while
      every hair in his head stood up curiously. A wild, haunting, feminine
      scream arose to a quavering soprano and sobbed away into silence. No words
      can adequately describe the unearthly wail in that cry and it took a full
      half-minute for Johnny to become himself again and to understand what it
      was. Once more it arose, nearer, and Johnny peered into the shadows along
      a rough backbone of rock, his Colt balanced in his half-raised hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come 'round me an' you'll get hurt,&rdquo; he muttered, straining his eyes
      to peer into the blackness of the shadows. &ldquo;Come on out, Soft-foot; the
      moon's yore finish. You an' me will have it out right here an' now&mdash;I
      don't want no cougar trailing me through that ink-black canyon on a
      two-foot ledge&mdash;&rdquo; he thought he saw a shadow glide across a dim patch
      of moonlight, but when his smoke rifted he knew he had missed. &ldquo;Damn it!
      You've got a mate 'round here somewhere,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Well, I'll have
      to chance it, anyhow. Come on, bronc! Yo're shaking like a leaf&mdash;get
      out of this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he began to descend into the canyon he allowed his horse to pick its
      own way without any guidance from him, and gave all of his attention to
      the trail behind him. The horse could get along better by itself in the
      dark, and it was more than possible that one or two lithe cougars might be
      slinking behind him on velvet paws. The horse scraped along gingerly,
      feeling its way step by step, and sending stones rattling and clattering
      down the precipice at his left to tinkle into the stream at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, but I wish I'd not wasted so much time,&rdquo; muttered the rider
      uneasily. &ldquo;This here canyon-cougar combination is the worst <i>I</i> ever
      butted up against. I'll never be late again, not never; not for all the
      girls in the world. Easy, bronc,&rdquo; he cautioned, as he felt the animal slip
      and quiver. &ldquo;Won't this trail ever start going up again?&rdquo; he growled
      petulantly, taking his eyes off the black back trail, where no amount of
      scrutiny showed him anything, and turned in the saddle to peer ahead&mdash;and
      a yell of surprise and fear burst from him, while chills ran up and down
      his spine. An unearthly, piercing shriek suddenly rang out and filled the
      canyon with ear-splitting uproar and a glowing, sheeted half-figure of a
      man floated and danced twenty feet from him and over the chasm. He jerked
      his gun and fired, but only once, for his mount had its own ideas about
      some things and this particular one easily headed the list. The startled
      rider grabbed reins and pommel, his blood congealed with fear of the
      precipice less than a foot from his side, and he gave all his attention to
      the horse. But scared as he was he heard, or thought that he heard, a
      peculiar sound when he fired, and he would have sworn that he hit the mark&mdash;the
      striking of the bullet was not drowned in the uproar and he would never
      forget the sound of that impact. He rounded Big Bend as if he were coming
      up to the judge's stand, and when he struck the upslant of the emerging
      trail he had made a record. Cold sweat beaded his forehead and he was
      trembling from head to foot when he again rode into the moonlight on the
      level plain, where he tried to break another record.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JOHNNY ARRIVES
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Hopalong and Red quarrelled petulantly and damned the erring
      Johnny with enthusiastic abandon, while Dent smiled at them and joked; but
      his efforts at levity made little impression on the irate pair. Red, true
      to his word, had turned up at the time set, in fact, he was half an hour
      ahead of time, for which miracle he endeavored to take great and
      disproportionate credit. Dent was secretly glad about the delay, for he
      found his place lonesome. He thoroughly enjoyed the company of the two
      gentlemen from the Bar-20, whose actions seemed to be governed by whims
      and who appeared to lack all regard for consequences; and they squabbled
      so refreshingly, and spent their money cheerfully. Now, if they would only
      wind up the day by fighting! Such a finish would be joy indeed. And
      speaking of fights, Dent was certain that Mr. Cassidy had been in one
      recently, for his face bore marks that could only be acquired in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the two guests had relapsed into a silence which endured only
      as long as the pleasing fulness. Then the squabbling began again, growing
      worse until they fell silent from lack of adequate expression. Finally Red
      once again spoke of their absent friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We oughtn't get peevish, Hoppy&mdash;he's only thirty-six hours late,&rdquo;
       suggested Red. &ldquo;An' he might be a week,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, as his
      mind ran back over a long list of Johnny's misdeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he might. An' won't he have a fine cock-an'-bull tale to explain
      it,&rdquo; growled Hopalong, reminiscently. &ldquo;His excuses are the worst part of
      it generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, does he&mdash;make excuses?&rdquo; asked Dent, mildly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does to <i>us</i>,&rdquo; retorted Red savagely. &ldquo;He's worse than a woman;
      take him all in all an' you've got the toughest proposition that ever wore
      pants. But he's a good feller, at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've got a lot of nerve, you have!&rdquo; retorted Hopalong. &ldquo;You don't
      want to say anything about the Kid&mdash;if there's anybody that can beat
      him in being late an' acting the fool generally, it's you. An' what's
      more, you know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red wheeled to reply, but was interrupted by a sudden uproar outside,
      fluent swearing coming towards the house. The door opened with a bang,
      admitting a white-faced, big-eyed man with one leg jammed through the box
      he had landed on in dismounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme a drink, quick!&rdquo; he shouted wildly, dragging the box over to the
      bar with a cheerful disregard for chairs and other temporary obstructions.
      &ldquo;Gimme a drink!&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you six hops in the neck!&rdquo; yelled Red, missing and almost sitting
      down because of the enthusiasm he had put into his effort. Johnny
      side-stepped and ducked, and as he straightened up to ask for whys and
      wherefores, Red's eyes opened wide and he paused in his further intentions
      to stare at the apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick?&rdquo; queried Hopalong, who was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme that drink!&rdquo; demanded Johnny feverishly, and when he had it he
      leaned against the bar and mopped his face with a trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Red, with deep anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for God's sake, what's happened to you?&rdquo; demanded Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny breathed deeply and threw back his shoulders as if to shake off a
      weight. &ldquo;Fellers, I had a cougar soft-footing after me in that dark
      canyon, my cayuse ran away on a two-foot ledge up the wall,<i>&mdash;an'&mdash;I&mdash;saw&mdash;a&mdash;ghost</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a respectful silence. Johnny, waiting a reasonable length of
      time for replies and exclamations, flushed a bit and repeated his frank
      and candid statement, adding a few adjectives to it. &ldquo;<i>A real,
      screeching, flying ghost</i>! An' I'm going <i>home</i>, an' I'm going to
      <i>stay</i> there. I ain't never coming back no more, not for anything.
      Damn this border country, <i>anyhow</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence continued, whereupon Johnny grew properly indignant. &ldquo;You act
      like I told you it was going to rain! Why don't you say something? Didn't
      you hear what I said, you fools!&rdquo; he asked pugnaciously. &ldquo;Are you in the
      habit of having a thing like that told you? Why don't you show some
      interest, you dod-blasted, thick-skulled wooden-heads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red looked at Hopalong, Hopalong looked at Red, and then they both looked
      at Dent, whose eyes were fixed in a stare on Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Hopalong, warily arising. &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; he asked, nodding
      at Red, who also arose and began to move cautiously toward their erring
      friend. &ldquo;Didn't you see no more'n one ghost? Anybody that can see one
      ghost, an' no more, is wrong somewhere. Now, stop, an' think; didn't you
      see <i>two</i>?&rdquo; He was advancing carefully while he talked, and Red was
      now behind the man who saw one ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&mdash;&rdquo; there was a sudden flurry and Johnny's words were cut
      short in the melee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, Red! Ouch!&rdquo; shouted Hopalong. &ldquo;Look out! Got any rope, Dent? Well,
      hurry up: there ain't no telling what he'll do if he's loose. The mescal
      they sells down in this country ain't liquor&mdash;it's poison,&rdquo; he
      panted. &ldquo;An' he can't even stand whiskey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding the rope was easier than finding a place to put it, and the
      unequal battle raged across the room and into the next, where it sounded
      as if the house were falling down. Johnny's voice was shrill and full of
      vexation and his words were extremely impolite and lacked censoring. His
      feet appeared to be numerous and growing rapidly, judging from the amount
      of territory they covered and defended, and Red joyfully kicked Hopalong
      in the melee, which in this instance also stands for stomach; Red always
      took great pains to do more than his share in a scrimmage. Dent hovered on
      the flanks, his hands full of rope, and begged with great earnestness to
      be allowed to apply it to parts of Johnny's thrashing anatomy. But as the
      flanks continued to change with bewildering swiftness he begged in vain,
      and began to make suggestions and give advice pleasing to the three
      combatants. Dent knew just how it should be done, and was generous with
      the knowledge until Johnny zealously planted five knuckles on his one good
      eye, when the engagement became general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table skidded through the door on one leg and caromed off the bar at a
      graceful angle, collecting three chairs and one sand-box cuspidor on the
      way. The box on Johnny's leg had long since departed, as Hopalong's shin
      could testify. One chair dissolved unity and distributed itself lavishly
      over the room, while the bed shrunk silently and folded itself on top of
      Dent, who bucked it up and down with burning zeal and finally had sense
      enough to crawl from under it. He immediately celebrated his liberation by
      getting a strangle hold on two legs, one of which happened to be the
      personal property of Hopalong Cassidy; and the battle raged on a lower
      plane. Red raised one hand as he carefully traced a neck to its own proper
      head and then his steel fingers opened and swooped down and shut off the
      dialect. Hopalong pushed Dent off him and managed to catch Johnny's
      flaying arm on the third attempt, while Dent made tentative sorties
      against Johnny's spurred boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew! Can he fight like that when he's sober?&rdquo; reverently asked Dent,
      seeing how close his fingers could come to his gaudy eye without touching
      it. &ldquo;I won't be able to see at all in an hour,&rdquo; he added, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong, seated on Johnny's chest, soberly made reply as he tenderly
      flirted with a raw shin. &ldquo;It's the mescal. I'm going to slip some of that
      stuff into Pete's cayuse some of these days,&rdquo; he promised, happy with a
      new idea. Pete Wilson had no sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ghost was plumb lucky,&rdquo; grunted Red, &ldquo;an' so was the sea-captain,&rdquo;
       he finished as an afterthought, limping off toward the bar, slowly and
      painfully followed by his disfigured companions. &ldquo;One drink; then to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Red had departed, Hopalong and Dent smoked a while and then,
      knocking the ashes out of his pipe, Hopalong arose. &ldquo;An' yet, Dent, there
      are people that believe in ghosts,&rdquo; he remarked, with a vast and settled
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dent gave critical scrutiny to the scratched bar for a moment. &ldquo;Well, the
      Greasers all say there <i>is</i> a ghost in the San Miguel, though I never
      saw it. But some of them have seen it, an' no Greasers ride that trail no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Hopalong. &ldquo;Some Greasers must have filled the Kid up on
      ghosts while he was filling hisself up on mescal. Ghosts? R-a-t-s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows itself only to Greasers, an' then only on Friday nights,&rdquo;
       explained Dent, thoughtfully. This was Friday night. Others had seen that
      ghost, but they were all Mexicans; now that a &ldquo;white&rdquo; man of Johnny's
      undisputed calibre had been so honored Dent's skepticism wavered and he
      had something to think about for days to come. True, Johnny was not a
      Greaser; but even ghosts might make mistakes once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong laughed, dismissing the subject from his mind as being beneath
      further comment. &ldquo;Well, we won't argue&mdash;I'm too tired. An' I'm sorry
      you got that eye, Dent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; hastily assured the store-keeper, smiling faintly.
      &ldquo;I was just spoiling for a fight, an' now I've had it. Feels sort of good.
      Yes, first thing in the morning&mdash;breakfast'll be ready soon as you
      are. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the proprietor couldn't sleep. Finally he arose and tiptoed into the
      room where Johnny lay wrapped in the sleep of the exhausted. After
      cautious and critical inspection, which was made hard because of his
      damaged eye, he tiptoed back to his bunk, shaking his head slowly. &ldquo;He
      wasn't drunk,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He saw that ghost all right; an' I'll bet
      everything I've got on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak three quarrelling punchers rode homeward and after a
      monotonous journey arrived at the bunk house and reported. It took them
      two nights adequately to describe their experiences to an envious
      audience. The morning after the telling of the ghost story things began to
      happen. Red starting it by erecting a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTISE&mdash;NO GHOSTS ALOWED
    </p>
    <p>
      An exuberant handful of the outfit watched him drive the last nail and
      step back to admire his work, and the running fire of comment covered all
      degrees of humor, and promised much hilarity in the future at the expense
      of the only man on the Bar-20 who had seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week Johnny and his acute vision had become a bye-word in that part
      of the country and his friends had made it a practice to stop him and
      gravely discuss spirit manifestations of all kinds. He had thrashed Wood
      Wright and been thrashed by Sandy Lucas in two beautiful and memorable
      fights and was only waiting to recover from the last affair before having
      the matter out with Rich Finn. These facts were beginning to have the
      effect he strove for; though Cowan still sold a new concoction of gin,
      brandy, and whiskey which he called &ldquo;Flying Ghost,&rdquo; and which he proudly
      guaranteed would show more ghosts per drink than any liquor south of the
      Rio Grande&mdash;and some of his patrons were eager to back up his claims
      with real money.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the condition of affairs when Hopalong Cassidy strolled into
      Cowan's and forgot his thirst in the story being told by a strange
      Mexican. It was Johnny's ghost, without a doubt, and when he had
      carelessly asked a few questions he was convinced that Johnny had really
      seen something. On the way home he cogitated upon it and two points
      challenged his intelligence with renewed insistence: the ghost showed
      itself only on Friday, and then only to &ldquo;Greasers.&rdquo; His suspicious mind
      would not rest until he had reviewed the question from all sides, and his
      opinion was that there was something more than spiritual about the ghost
      of the San Miguel&mdash;and a cold, practical reason for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rode into the corral at the ranch he saw that another sign had
      been put on the corral wall. He had destroyed the first, speaking his mind
      in full at the time. He swept his gloved hand upward with a rush, tore the
      flimsy board from its fastenings, broke it to pieces across his saddle,
      and tossed the fragments from him. He was angry, for he had warned the
      outfit that they were carrying the joke too far, that Johnny was giving
      way to hysterical rage more frequently, and might easily do something that
      they all would regret. And he felt sorry for the Kid; he knew what
      Johnny's feelings were and he made up his mind to start a few fights
      himself if the persecution did not cease. When he stepped into the bunk
      house and faced his friends they listened to a three-minute speech that
      made them squirm, and as he finished talking the deep voice of the foreman
      endorsed the promises he had just heard made, for Buck had entered the
      gallery without being noticed. The joke had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Johnny rode in that evening he was surprised to find Hopalong waiting
      for him a short distance from the corral and he replied to his friend's
      gesture by riding over to him. &ldquo;What's up now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along with me. I want to talk to you for a few minutes,&rdquo; and
      Hopalong led the way toward the open, followed by Johnny, who was more or
      less suspicious. Finally Hopalong stopped, turned, and looked his
      companion squarely in the eyes. &ldquo;Kid, I'm in dead earnest. This ain't no
      fool joke&mdash;now you tell me what that ghost looked like, how he acted,
      an' all about it. I mean what I say, because now I know that you saw <i>something</i>.
      If it wasn't a ghost it was made to look like one, anyhow. Now go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've told you a dozen times already,&rdquo; retorted Johnny, his face flushing.
      &ldquo;I've begged you to believe me an' told you that I wasn't fooling. How do
      I know you ain't now? I'm not going to tell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on; yes, you are. Yo're going to tell it slow, an' just like you saw
      it,&rdquo; Hopalong interrupted hastily. &ldquo;I know I've doubted it, but who
      wouldn't! Wait a minute&mdash;I've done a heap of thinking in the past few
      days an' I know that you saw a ghost. Now, everybody knows that there
      ain't no such thing as ghosts; then what was it you saw? There's a game
      on, Kid, an' it's a dandy; an' you an' me are going to bust it up an' get
      the laugh on the whole blasted crowd, from Buck to Cowan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny's suspicions left him with a rush, for his old Hoppy was one man in
      a thousand, and when he spoke like that, with such sharp decision, Johnny
      knew what it meant. Hopalong listened intently and when the short account
      was finished he put out his hand and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're the fools, Kid; not you. There's something crooked going on in that
      canyon, an' I know it! But keep mum about what we think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny lost his grouch so suddenly and beamed upon his friends with such a
      superior air that they began to worry about what was in the wind. The
      suspense wore on them, for with Hopalong's assistance, Johnny might spring
      some game on them all that would more than pay up for the fun they had
      enjoyed at his expense; and the longer the suspense lasted the worse it
      became. They never lost sight of him while he was around and Hopalong had
      to endure the same surveillance; and it was no uncommon thing to see small
      groups of the anxious men engaged in deep discussion. When they found that
      Buck must have been told and noticed his smile was as fixed as Hopalong's
      or Johnny's, they were certain that trouble of some nature was in store
      for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several weeks later Buck Peters drew rein and waited for a stranger to
      join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy. Is yore name Peters?&rdquo; asked the newcomer, sizing him up in one
      trained glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who are you, an' what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Peters, Buck Peters. That yore name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Fox. Old Jim Lane gave me a message for you,&rdquo; and the stranger
      spoke earnestly to some length. &ldquo;There; that's the situation. We've got to
      have shrewd men that they don't know an' won't suspect. Lane wants to pay
      a couple of yore men their wages for a month or two. He said he was shore
      he could count on you to help him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's right; he can. I don't forget favors. I've got a couple of men that&mdash;there's
      one of 'em now. Hey, Hoppy! Whoop-e, Hoppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy arrived quickly, listened eagerly, named Red and Johnny to
      accompany him, overruled his companions by insisting that if Johnny didn't
      go the whole thing was off, carried his point, and galloped off to find
      the lucky two, his eyes gleaming with anticipation and joy. Fox laughed,
      thanked the foreman, and rode on his way north; and that night three
      cow-punchers rode south, all strangely elated. And the friends who watched
      them go heaved signs of relief, for the reprisals evidently were to be
      postponed for a while.

      THE GHOST OF THE SAN MIGUEL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Juan Alvarez had not been in San Felippe since Dick Martin left, which
      meant for over a month. Martin was down the river looking for a man who
      did not wish to be found; and some said that Martin cared nothing about
      international boundaries when he wanted any one real bad. And there was
      that geologist who wore blue glasses and was always puttering around in
      the canyon and hammering chips of rock off the steep walls; he must have
      slipped one noon, because his body was found on a flat boulder at the edge
      of the stream. Manuel had found it and wanted to be paid for his trouble
      in bringing it to town&mdash;but Manuel was a fool. Who, indeed, would pay
      good money for a dead Gringo, especially after he was dead? And there were
      three cow-punchers holding a herd of 6-X cattle up north, an hour or so
      from the town. They wanted to buy steers from Senor Rodriguez, but said
      that he was a robber and threatened to cut his ears off. Cannot a man name
      his own price? These cow-punchers liked to get drunk and gallop through
      San Felippe, shooting like crazy men. They got drunk one Friday night and
      went shouting and singing to the Big Bend in the canyon to see the flying
      ghost, and they called it names and fired off their pistols and sang
      loudly; and for a week they insulted all the Mexicans in town by calling
      them liars and cowards. Was it the fault of any one that the ghost would
      show itself only to Mexicans? Oh, these Gringos&mdash;might the good God
      punish them for their sins!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the peons complained to the padre while they kept one eye open for
      the advent of the rowdy cow-punchers, who always wanted to drink, and then
      to fight with some one, either with fists or pistols. Why should any one
      fight with them, especially with such things as fists?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them fight among themselves. What have you to do with heretics?&rdquo;
       reproved the good padre, who ostracized himself from the pleasant parts of
      the wide world that he might make easier the life and struggles of his
      ignorant flock. &ldquo;God is not hasty&mdash;He will punish in His own way when
      it best suits Him. And perhaps you will profit much if you are more
      regular to mass instead of wasting the cool hours of the morning in bed.
      Think well of what I have said, my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the cow-punchers were not punished and they swore they would not leave
      the vicinity until they had all the steers they wanted, and at their own
      price. And one night their herd stampeded and was checked only in time to
      save it from going over the canyon's edge. And for some reason Sanchez
      kept out of the padre's way and did not go to confess when he should, for
      the padre spoke plainly and set hard obligations for penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow-punchers swore that it had been done by some Mexican and said that
      they would come to town some day soon and kill three Mexicans unless the
      guilty one was found and brought to them. Then the padre mounted his
      donkey and went out to them to argue and they finally told him they would
      wait for two weeks. But the padre was too smart for them&mdash;he sent a
      messenger to find Senor Dick Martin, and in one week Senor Martin came to
      town. There was no fight. The Gringo rowdies were cowards at heart and
      Martin could not shoot them down in cold blood, and he could not arrest
      them, because he was not a policeman or even a sheriff, but only a revenue
      officer, which was a most foolish law. But he watched them all the time
      and wanted them to fight&mdash;there was no more shooting or drunkenness
      in town. Nobody wanted to fight Senor Martin, for he was a great man. He
      even went so far as to talk with them about it and wave his arms, but they
      were as frightened at him as little children might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Mexicans gossiped and exulted, some of the bolder of them even
      swaggering out to the Gringo camp; but Martin drove them back again,
      saying he would not allow them to bully men who could not retaliate, which
      was right and fair. Then, afraid to go away and leave the mad cow-punchers
      so close to town, he ordered them to drive their herd farther east, nearer
      to Dent's store, and never to return to San Felippe unless they needed the
      padre; and they obeyed him after a long talk. After seeing them settled in
      their new camp, which was on Monday morning, Martin returned to San
      Felippe and told the padre where he could be found and then rode away
      again. San Felippe celebrated for a whole day and two Mexican babies were
      christened after Senor Dick Martin, which was honor all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday, when Manuel went over to spy upon the cow-punchers in their new
      camp, he found them so drunk that they could not stand, and before he
      crept away at dusk two of them were sleeping like gorged snakes and the
      third was firing off his revolver at random, which diversion had not a
      little to do with Manuel's departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Manuel crept away he headed straight for a crevice near the wall of
      the canyon at the Big Bend and, reaching it, looked all around and then
      dropped into it. Not long thereafter another Mexican appeared, this one
      from San Felippe, and also disappeared into the crevice. As darkness fell
      Manuel reappeared with something under his jacket and a moment later a
      light gleamed at the base of a slender sapling which grew on the edge of
      the canyon wall and leaned out over the abyss. It was cleverly placed, for
      only at one spot on the Mexican side of the distant Rio Grande could it be
      seen&mdash;the high canyon walls farther down screened it from any one who
      might be riding on the north bank of the river. In a moment there came an
      answering twinkle and Manuel, covering the lantern with a blanket, was
      swallowed up in the darkness of the crevice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a trace of emotion, Dick Martin, from his place of concealment,
      caught the answering gleam, and he watched Manuel disappear. &ldquo;Cassidy was
      right in every point; Lewis or Sayre couldn't 'a' done this better. I hope
      he won't be late,&rdquo; he muttered, and settled himself more comfortably to
      wait for the cue for action, smiling as the moon poked its rim over the
      low hills to his right. &ldquo;This means promotion for me, or I've very much
      mistaken,&rdquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong was not late and as soon as it was dark he and his companions
      stole into the canyon on foot. They felt their way down the east end of
      the trail, not far from Dent's, toward the Big Bend, which they gained
      without a mishap. Johnny was sent up to a place they had noticed and
      marked in their memories at the time they had rioted down to defy the
      ghost. He was to stop any one trying to escape up the San Felippe end of
      the canyon trail, and his confidence in his ability to do this was
      exuberant. Hopalong and Red slowly and laboriously worked their way down
      the perilous path leading to the bottom, forded the stream, and crept up
      the other side, where they found cover not far from a wide crack in the
      canyon wall. Upon the occasion of their hilarious visit to the Big Bend
      they had observed that a faint trail led to the crack and had cogitated
      deeply upon this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours passed before the watchers in and above the canyon were
      rewarded by anything further; and then a light flickered far down the
      canyon and close to the edge of the stream. Immediately strange noises
      were heard and suddenly the ghost swung out of the opening in the rock
      wall near Hopalong and Red and danced above their heads, while the
      shrieking which had so frightened Johnny and his horse filled the canyon
      with uproar and sent Martin wriggling nearer to the crevice which he had
      watched so closely. The noise soon ceased, but the ghost danced on, and
      the sound of men stumbling along the rocky ledge bordering the stream
      became more and more audible. Four were in the party and they all carried
      bulky loads on their backs and grunted with pleasure and relief as they
      entered the entrance in the wall. When the last man had disappeared and
      the noise of their passing had died out, Johnny's rope sailed up and out,
      and the ghost swayed violently and then began to sag in an unaccountable
      manner towards the trail as the owner of the rope hitched its free end
      around a spur of rock and made it fast. Then he feverishly scrambled down
      the steep path to join his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong and Red, wriggling on their stomachs towards the crack in the
      wall, paused in amazement and stared across the canyon; and then the
      former chuckled and whispered something in his companion's ear. &ldquo;That was
      why he lugged his rope along! He's just idiot enough to want a souveneer
      an' plaything at the risk of losing the game. Come on!&mdash;they'll
      tumble to what's up an' get away if we don't hustle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two punchers cautiously and noiselessly entered the crack and
      felt their way along its rock walls they heard fluent swearing in Spanish
      by the man who worked the ghost, and who could not understand its sudden
      ambition to take root. It was made painfully clear to him a moment later
      when a pair of brawny hands reached out of the darkness behind him and
      encircled his throat a hand's width below his gleaming cigarette. Another
      pair used cords with deftness and despatch and he was left by himself to
      browse upon the gag when all his senses returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong, with Red inconsiderately stepping on his heels, felt his way
      along the wall of the crevice, alert and silent, his Colt nestling
      comfortably in his right hand, while the left was pushed out ahead feeling
      for trouble. As they worked farther away from the canyon distant voices
      could be heard and they forthwith proceeded even more cautiously. When
      Hopalong came to the second bend in the narrow passage he peered around it
      and stopped so abruptly that Red's nose almost spread itself over the back
      of his head. Red's indignation was all the harder to bear because it must
      bloom unheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a huge, irregular room, whose roof could not be discerned in the dim
      light of the few candles, five men were resting in various attitudes of
      ease as they discussed the events of the night and tried to compute their
      profits. They were secure, for Manuel, having by this time put away the
      ghost and megaphone, was on duty at the mouth of the crevice, and he was
      as sensitive to danger as a hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The risk is not much and the profits are large,&rdquo; remarked Pedro, in
      Spanish. &ldquo;We must burn a candle for the repose of the soul of Carlos
      Martinez. It is he that made our plans safe. And a candle is not much when
      we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; said a quiet voice, followed by grim commands. The Mexicans
      jumped as if stung by a scorpion, and could just discern two of the rowdy
      gringo cow-punchers in the heavy shadows of the opposite wall, but the
      candle light glinted in rings on the muzzles of their six-shooters. Had
      Manuel betrayed them? But they had little time or inclination for
      cogitation regarding Manuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy there!&rdquo; shouted Red, and Pedro's hand stopped when half way to his
      chest. Pedro was a gambler by nature, but the odds were too heavy and he
      sullenly obeyed the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick 'em up! Stick 'em up! Higher yet, an' hold 'em there,&rdquo; purred a
      soft voice from the other end of the room, where Dick Martin smiled
      pleasantly upon them and wondered if there was anything on earth harder to
      pound good common sense into than a &ldquo;Greaser's&rdquo; head. His gun was blue,
      but it was, nevertheless, the most prominent part of his make-up, even if
      the light was poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Mexicans reached involuntarily for his gun, for he was a
      gun-man by training; while his companions felt for their knives, deadly
      weapons in a melee. Martin, crying, &ldquo;Watch 'em, Cassidy!&rdquo; side-stepped and
      lunged forward with the speed and skill of a boxer, and his hard left hand
      landed on the point of Juan Alvarez' jaw with a force and precision not to
      be withstood. But to make more certain that the Mexican would not take
      part in any possible demonstration of resistance, Martin's right circled
      up in a short half-hook and stopped against Juan's short ribs. Martin
      weighed one hundred and eighty pounds and packed no fat on his well-knit
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a two-legged cyclone burst upon the scene in the person of
      Johnny Nelson, whose rage had been worked up almost to the weeping point
      because he had lost so much time hunting for the crevice where it was not.
      Seeing Juan fall, and the glint of knives, he started in to clean things
      up, yelling, &ldquo;I'm a ghost! I'm a ghost! Take 'em alive! Take 'em alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong and Red felt that they were in his way, and taking care of one
      Mexican between them, while Martin knocked out another, they watched the
      exits,&mdash;for anything was possible in such a chaotic mix-up,&mdash;and
      gave Johnny plenty of room. The latter paused, triumphant, looked around
      to see if he had missed any, and then advanced upon his friends and shoved
      his jaw up close to Hopalong's face. &ldquo;Tried to lose me, didn't you!
      Wouldn't wait for me! For seven cents an' a toothbrush I'd give you what's
      left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red grabbed him by trousers and collar and heaved him into the passageway.
      &ldquo;Go out an' play with yore souveneer or we'll step on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny sat up, rubbed certain portions of his anatomy, and grinned. &ldquo;Oh,
      I've got it, all right! I'm shore going to take that ghost home an' make
      some of them fools <i>eat</i> it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin smiled as he finished tying the last prisoner. &ldquo;That's right,
      Nelson; you've got it on 'em this time. Make 'em chew it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOPALONG LOSES A HORSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a month after their return from the San Miguel, Hopalong and his
      companions worked with renewed zest, and told and retold the other members
      of the outfit of their unusual experiences near the Mexican border. Word
      had come up to them that Martin had secured the conviction of the
      smugglers and was in line for immediate advancement. No one on the range
      had the heart to meet Johnny Nelson, for Johnny carried with him a piece
      of the ghost, and became pugnacious if his once-jeering friends and
      acquaintances refused to nibble on it. Cowan still sold his remarkable
      drink, but he had yielded to Johnny's persuasive methods and now called it
      &ldquo;Nelson's Pet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One bright day the outfit started rounding up a small herd of
      three-year-olds, which Buck had sold, and by the end of the week the herd
      was complete and ready for the drive. This took two weeks and when
      Hopalong led his drive outfit through Hoyt's Corners on its homeward
      journey he felt the pull of the town of Grant, some miles distant, and it
      was too strong to be resisted. Flinging a word of explanation to the
      nearest puncher, he turned to lope away, when Red's voice checked him. Red
      wanted to delay his home-coming for a day or two and attend to a purely
      personal matter at a ranch lying to the west. Hopalong, knowing the reason
      for Red's wish, grinned and told him to go, and not to propose until he
      had thought the matter over very carefully. Red's reply was
      characteristic, and after arranging a rendezvous and naming the time, the
      two separated and rode toward their destinations, while the rest of the
      outfit kept on towards their ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man owes something to <i>all</i> his friends,&rdquo; Hopalong mused. In this
      case he owed a return game of draw poker to certain of Grant's leading
      citizens, and he liked to pay his obligations when opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mid-afternoon when he topped a rise and saw below him the handful
      of shacks making up the town. A look of pleased interest flickered across
      his face as he noticed a patched and dirty tent pitched close up to the
      nearest shack. &ldquo;Show!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now, ain't that luck! I'll shore
      take it in. If it's a circus, mebby it has a trick mule to ride&mdash;I'll
      never forget that one up in Kansas City,&rdquo; he grinned. But almost instantly
      a doubt arose and tempered the grin. &ldquo;Huh! Mebby it's the branding chute
      of some gospel sharp.&rdquo; As he drew near he focussed his eyes on the canvas
      and found that his fears were justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Are Welcome,&rdquo; he spelled out slowly. &ldquo;Shore they are!&rdquo; he muttered.
      &ldquo;I never nowhere saw such hard-working, all-embracing rustlers as them
      fellers. They'll stick their iron on anything from a wobbly calf or dying
      dogie to a staggering-with-age mosshead, an' shout 'tally one' with the
      same joy. Well, not for mine, <i>this</i> trip. I'm going to graze loose
      an' buck-jump all I wants. Anyhow, if I did let him brand me I'd only
      backslide in a week,&rdquo; and Hopalong pressed his pony to a more rapid gait
      as two men emerged from the tent. &ldquo;There's the sky-pilot now,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;&ldquo;an'
      there's Dave!&rdquo; he shouted, waving his arm. &ldquo;Oh, Dave! Dave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dave Wilkes looked up, and his grin of delight threatened to engulf his
      ears. &ldquo;Hullo, Cassidy! Glad to see you! Keep right on for the store&mdash;I'll
      be with you in a minute.&rdquo; When David told his companion the visitor's name
      the evangelist held up his hand eloquently and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about him!&rdquo; he exclaimed sorrowfully. &ldquo;If I can lead him out
      of his wickedness I will rest content though I save no more souls this
      fortnight. Is it all true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! What true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I have heard about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno what you've heard,&rdquo; replied Dave, with grave caution, &ldquo;but
      I reckon it might be if it didn't cover lying, stealing, cowardice, an'
      such coyote traits. He's shore a holy terror with a short gun, all right,
      but lemme tell you something mebby you <i>ain't</i> heard: There ain't a
      square man in this part of the country that won't feel some honored an'
      proud to be called a friend of Hopalong Cassidy. Them's the sentiments
      rampaging hereabouts. I ain't denying that he's gone an' killed off a lot
      of men first an' last&mdash;but the only trouble there is that he didn't
      get 'em soon enough. They all had lived too blamed long when they went an'
      stacked up agin him an' that lightning short gun of hissn. But, say, if
      yo're calculating to tackle him at yore game, lead him gentle&mdash;don't
      push none. He comes to life real sudden when he's shoved. So long; see you
      later, mebby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The revivalist looked after him and mused, &ldquo;I hope I was informed wrong,
      but this much I have to be thankful for: The wickedness of most of these
      men, these over-grown children, is manly, stalwart, and open; few of them
      are vicious or contemptible. Their one great curse is drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Hopalong entered the store he was vociferously welcomed by two men,
      and the proprietor joining them, the circle was complete. When the
      conversation threatened to repeat itself cards were brought and the next
      two hours passed very rapidly. They were expensive hours to the Bar-20
      puncher, who finally arose with an apologetic grin and slapped his thigh
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've got it all; I'm busted wide open, except for a measly
      dollar, an' I shore hopes you don't want that,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;You play a
      whole lot better than you did the last time I was here. I've got to move
      along. I'm going east an' see Wallace an' from there I've got to meet Red
      an' ride home with him. But you come an' see us when you can&mdash;it's <i>me</i>
      that wants revenge this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh; you'll be wanting it worse than ever if we do,&rdquo; smiled Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hoppy,&rdquo; advised Tom Lawrence, &ldquo;better drop in an' hear the
      sky-pilot's palaver before you go. It'll do you a whole lot of good, an'
      it can't do you no harm, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You going?&rdquo; asked Hopalong suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't&mdash;got too much work to do,&rdquo; quickly responded Tom, his brother
      Art nodding happy confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh; I reckoned so!&rdquo; snorted Hopalong sarcastically, as he shook hands
      all around. &ldquo;You all know where to find us&mdash;drop in an' see us when
      you get down our way,&rdquo; he invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry you can't stay longer, Cassidy,&rdquo; remarked Dave, as his friend
      mounted. &ldquo;But come up again soon&mdash;an' be shore to tell all the boys
      we was asking for 'em,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the speed with which Hopalong started for Wallace's, he might
      have been expecting a relay of &ldquo;quarter&rdquo; horses to keep it going, but he
      pulled up short at the tent. Such inconsistency is trying to the temper of
      the best-mannered horse, and this particular animal was not in the least
      good-mannered, wherefore its rider was obliged to soothe its resentment in
      his own peculiar way, listening meanwhile to the loud and impassioned
      voice of the evangelist haranguing his small audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Hopalong, glancing through the door, &ldquo;if them friends of
      mine reckon I'm any ascared to go in that tent? Huh, I'll just show 'em
      anyhow!&rdquo; whereupon he dismounted, flung the reins over his horse's head,
      and strode through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest seat, a bench made by placing a bottom board of the
      evangelist's wagon across two up-ended boxes, was close enough to the
      exhorter and he dropped into it and glanced carelessly at his nearest
      neighbor. The carelessness went out of his bearing as his eyes fastened
      themselves in a stare on the man's neck-kerchief. Hopalong was hardened to
      awful sights and at his best was not an artistic soul, but the villainous
      riot of fiery crimson, gaudy yellow, and pugnacious and domineering green
      which flaunted defiance and insolence from the stranger's neck caused his
      breath to hang over one count and then come double strong at the next
      exhalation. &ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger slowly turned his head and looked coldly upon the impudent
      disturber of his reverent reflections. &ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; he questioned, with an
      upward slant in his voice. The neck-kerchief seemed to grow suddenly
      malignant and about to spring. &ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; repeated the other with great
      insolence, while his eyes looked a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hopalong's eyes left the scrambled color-insult and tried to banish
      the horrible after-image, his mind groped for the rules of etiquette
      governing free fist fights in gospel tents, and while he hesitated as to
      whether he should dent the classic profile of the color-bearer or just
      twist his nose as a sign of displeasure, the voice of the evangelist arose
      to a roar and thundered out. Hopalong ducked instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Stop! Stop before it is too late, before death takes you in the
      wallow of your sins! Repent and gain salvation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong felt relieved, but his face retained its expression of childlike
      innocence even after he realized that he was not being personally
      addressed; and he glanced around. It took him ninety-seven seconds to see
      everything there was to be seen, and his eyes were drawn irresistibly back
      to the stranger's kerchief. &ldquo;Awful! Awful thing for a drinking man to
      wear, or run up against unexpectedly!&rdquo; he muttered, blinking. &ldquo;Worse than
      snakes,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look ahere, you&mdash;&rdquo; began the owner of the offensive decoration, if
      it might be called such, but the evangelist drowned his voice in another
      flight of eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;<i>Peace</i>! <i>Peace</i> is the message of the Lord to His
      children,&rdquo; roared the voice from the upturned soap box, and when the
      speaker turned and looked in the direction of the two
      men-with-a-difference he found them sitting up very straight and
      apparently drinking in his words with great relish; whereupon he felt that
      he was making gratifying progress toward the salvation of their spotted
      souls. He was very glad, indeed, that he had been so grievously
      misinformed about the personal attributes of one Hopalong Cassidy,&mdash;glad
      and thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death cometh as a thief in the night,&rdquo; the voice went on. &ldquo;Think of the
      friends who have gone before; who were well one minute and gone the next!
      And it must come to all of us, to all of us, to me and to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the afflicted neck started rocking the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is coming to somebody purty soon,&rdquo; murmured Hopalong. He began
      to sidle over towards his neighbor, his near hand doubled up into a huge
      knot of protuberant knuckles and white-streaked fingers; but as he was
      about to deliver his hint that he was greatly displeased at the antics of
      the bench, a sob came to his ears. Turning his head swiftly, he caught
      sight of the stranger's face, and sorrow was marked so strongly upon it
      that the sight made Hopalong gape. His hand opened slowly and he
      cautiously sidled back again, disgruntled, puzzled, and vexed at himself
      for having strayed into a game where he was so hopelessly at sea. He
      thought it all over carefully and then gave it up as being too deep for
      him to solve. But he determined one thing: He was not going to leave
      before the other man did, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' if I catch that howling kerchief outside,&rdquo; he muttered, smacking his
      lips with satisfaction at what was in store for it. His visit to Wallace
      was not very important, anyway, and it could wait on more important
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There sits a sinner!&rdquo; thundered out the exhorter, and Hopalong looked
      stealthily around for a sight of a villain. &ldquo;God only has the right to
      punish. 'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord, and whosoever takes the law
      into his own hands, whosoever takes human life, defies the Creator. There
      sits a man who has killed his fellow-men, his brothers! Are you not a
      sinner, <i>Cassidy</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cassidy jumped clear of the bench as he jerked his head around and stared
      over the suddenly outstretched arm and pointing finger of the speaker and
      into his accusing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me! Are you not a sinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong stood up, confused, bewildered, and then his suspended thoughts
      stirred and formed. &ldquo;Guilty, I reckon, an' in the first degree. But they
      didn't get no more'n what was coming to 'em, no more'n they earned. An'
      that's straight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know they didn't? How do you know they earned it? How do you
      <i>know</i>?&rdquo; demanded the evangelist, who was delighted with the chance
      to argue with a sinner. He had great faith in &ldquo;personal contact,&rdquo; and his
      was the assurance of training, of the man well rehearsed and fully
      prepared. And he knew that if he should be pinned into a corner by logic
      and asked for <i>his</i> proofs, that he could squirm out easily and take
      the offensive again by appealing to faith, the last word in sophistry, and
      a greater and more powerful weapon than intelligence. <i>This</i> was his
      game, and it was fixed; he could not lose if he could arouse enough
      interest in a man to hold him to the end of the argument. He continued to
      drive, to crowd. &ldquo;What right have you to think so? What right have you to
      judge them? Have you divine insight? Are you inspired? 'Judge not lest ye
      be judged,' saith the Lord, and you <i>dare</i> to fly in the face of that
      great command!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got me picking the pea in <i>this</i> game, all right,&rdquo; responded
      Hopalong, dropping back on the bench. &ldquo;But lemme tell you one thing;
      Command or no command, devine or not devine, I know when a man has lived
      too long, an' when he's going to try to get me. An' all the gospel sharps
      south of heaven can't stop me from handing a thief what he's earned. Go on
      with the show, but count me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the evangelist warmed to the attack, vaguely realizing that he had
      made a mistake in not heeding Dave Wilkes' tip, Hopalong became conscious
      of a sense of relief stealing over him and he looked around wonderingly
      for the cause. The man with the kerchief had &ldquo;folded his tents&rdquo; and
      departed; and Hopalong, heaving a sigh of satisfaction, settled himself
      more comfortably and gave real attention to the discourse, although he did
      not reply to the warm and eloquent man on the soap box. Suddenly he sat up
      with a start as he remembered that he had a long and hard ride before him
      if he wished to see Wallace, and arising, strode towards the exit, his
      chest up and his chin thrust out. The only reply he made to the excited
      and personal remarks of the revivalist was to stop at the door and drop
      his last dollar into the yeast box before passing out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood still and pondered, his head too full of what he had
      heard to notice that anything out of the ordinary had happened. Although
      the evangelist had adopted the wrong method he had gained more than he
      knew and Hopalong had something to take home with him and wrestle out for
      himself in spare moments; that is, he would have had but for one thing: As
      he slowly looked around for his horse he came to himself with a sharp
      jerk, and hot profanity routed the germ of religion incubating in his
      soul. His horse was missing! Here was a pretty mess, he thought savagely;
      and then his expression of anger and perplexity gave way to a flickering
      grin as the probable solution came to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, I never saw such a bunch to play jokes,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Won't
      they never grow up? They was watching me when I went inside an' sneaked up
      and rustled my cayuse. Well, I'll get back again without much trouble, all
      right. They ought to know me better by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, stranger!&rdquo; he called to a man who was riding past, &ldquo;have you seen
      anything of a skinny roan cayuse fifteen han's high, white stocking on the
      near foreleg, an' a bandage on the off fetlock, Bar-20 being the brand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, knowing the grinning inquisitor by sight, suspected that a
      joke was being played: he also knew Dave Wilkes and that gentleman's
      friends. He chuckled and determined to help it along a little. &ldquo;Shore did,
      pardner; saw a man leading him real cautious. Was he yourn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; not at all. He belonged to my great-great-grandfather, who left
      him to my second cousin. You see, I borrowed it,&rdquo; he grinned, making his
      way leisurely towards the general store, kept by his friend Dave, the
      joker. &ldquo;Funny how everybody likes a joke,&rdquo; he muttered, opening the door
      of the store. &ldquo;Hey, Dave,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilkes wheeled suddenly and stared. &ldquo;Why, I thought you was half-way
      to Wallace's by now!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you come back to lose that lone
      dollar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I lost that too. But yo're a real smart cuss, now ain't you?&rdquo; queried
      Hopalong, his eyes twinkling and his face wreathed with good humor. &ldquo;An'
      how innocent you act, too. Thought you could scare me, didn't you? Thought
      I'd go tearing 'round this fool town like a house afire, hey? Well, I
      reckon you can guess again. Now, I'm owning up that the joke's on me, so
      you hand over my cayuse, an' I'll make up for lost time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dave Wilkes' face expressed several things, but surprise was dominant.
      &ldquo;Why, I ain't even seen yore ol' cayuse, you chump! Last time I saw it you
      was on him, going like the devil. Did somebody pull you off it an' take it
      away from you?&rdquo; he demanded with great sarcasm. &ldquo;Is somebody abusing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong bit into a generous handful of dried apricots, chewed
      complacently for a moment, and replied: &ldquo;'At's aw right; I want my
      cayuse.&rdquo; Swallowing hastily, he continued: &ldquo;I want it, an' I've come to
      the right place for it, too. Hand it over, David.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod blast it, I tell you I ain't got it!&rdquo; retorted Dave, beginning to
      suspect that something was radically wrong. &ldquo;I ain't seen it, an' I don't
      know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong wiped his mouth with his sleeve. &ldquo;Well, then, Tom or Art does,
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they don't, neither; I watched 'em leave an' they rode straight out
      of town, an' went the other way, same as they allus do.&rdquo; Dave was getting
      irritated. &ldquo;Look here, you; are you joking or drunk, or both, or is that
      animule of yourn really missing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Hopalong, trying some new prunes. &ldquo;'Ese prunes er purty
      good,&rdquo; he mumbled, in grave congratulation. &ldquo;I don' get prunes like 'ese
      very of'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you don't! They ought to be good! Cost me thirty cents a
      half-pound,&rdquo; Dave retorted with asperity, anxiously shifting his feet. It
      didn't take much of a loss to wipe out a day's profits with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I don't reckon you paid none too much for 'em, at that,&rdquo; Mr. Cassidy
      responded, nodding his head in comprehension. &ldquo;Ain't no worms in 'em, is
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore there is!&rdquo; exploded Dave. &ldquo;Plumb full of 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say! Hardly know whether to take a chance with the worms or try
      the apricots. Ain't no worms in them, anyhow. But when am I going to get
      my cayuse? I've got a long way to go, an' delay is costly&mdash;how much
      did you say these yaller fellers cost?&rdquo; he asked significantly, trying
      another handful of apricots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the dead level, cross my heart an' hope to die, but I ain't seen yore
      cayuse since you left here,&rdquo; earnestly replied Dave. &ldquo;If you don't know
      where it is, then somebody went an' lifted it. It looks like it's up to
      you to do some hunting, 'stead of cultivating a belly-ache at <i>my</i>
      expense. <i>I</i> ain't trying to keep you, God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong glanced out of the window as he considered, and saw, entering the
      saloon, the same puncher who had confessed to seeing his horse. &ldquo;Hey Dave;
      wait a minute!&rdquo; and he dashed out of the store and made good time towards
      the liquid refreshment parlor. Dave promptly nailed the covers on the
      boxes of prunes and apricots and leaned innocently against the cracker box
      to await results, thinking hard all the while. It looked like a plain case
      of horse-stealing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; cried Hopalong, bouncing into the bar-room, &ldquo;where did you see
      that cayuse of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ancient relic of yore family was aheading towards Hoyt's Corners,&rdquo;
       the stranger replied, grinning broadly. &ldquo;It's a long walk. Have something
      before you starts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the walk! Who was riding him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't being rid when I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, man; that cayuse was stole from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat in the nature of a calamity, now ain't it?&rdquo; smiled the stranger,
      enjoying his contributions to the success of the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet yore life it is!&rdquo; shouted Hopalong, growing red and then pale.
      &ldquo;You tell me who was leading him, understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I couldn't see his face, honest I couldn't,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
      &ldquo;Every time I tried it I was shore blinded by the most awful an' horrible
      neck-kerchief I've ever had the hard luck to lay my eyes on. Of all the
      drunks I ever met, them there colors was&mdash;Hey! Wait a minute!&rdquo; he
      shouted at Hopalong's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave, gimme yore cayuse an' a rifle&mdash;quick!&rdquo; cried Hopalong from the
      middle of the street as he ran towards the store. &ldquo;Hypocrite
      son-of-a-hoss-thief went an' run mine off. Might 'a' knowed nobody but a
      thief could wear such a kerchief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you!&rdquo; shouted Dave, leading the way on the run towards the
      corral in the rear of his store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain't with me, neither!&rdquo; replied Hopalong, deftly saddling. &ldquo;This
      ain't no plain hoss-thief case&mdash;it's a private grudge. See you later,
      mebby,&rdquo; and he was pacing a cloud of dust towards the outskirts of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dave looked after him. &ldquo;Well, that feller has shore got a big start on
      you, but he can't keep ahead of that Doll of mine for very long. She can
      out-run anything in these parts. 'Sides, Cassidy's cayuse looked sort of
      done up, while mine's as fresh as a bird. That thief will get what's
      coming to him, all right.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. CASSIDY COGITATES
    </h3>
    <p>
      While Hopalong tried to find his horse, Ben Ferris pushed forward,
      circling steadily to the east and away from the direction of Hoyt's
      corners, which was as much a menace to his health and happiness as the
      town of Grant, twenty miles to his rear. If he could have been certain
      that no danger was nearer to him than these two towns, he would have felt
      vastly relieved, even if his horse was not fresh. During the last hour he
      had not urged it as hard as he had in the beginning of his flight and it
      had dropped to a walk for minutes at a stretch. This was not because he
      felt that he had plenty of time, but for the reason that he understood
      horses and could not afford to exhaust his mount so early in the chase. He
      glanced back from time to time as if fearing what might be on his trail,
      and well he might fear. According to all the traditions and customs of the
      range, both of which he knew well, somewhere between him and Grant was a
      posse of hard-riding cow-punchers, all anxious and eager for a glance at
      him over their sights. In his mind's eye he could see them, silent, grim,
      tenacious, reeling off the miles on that distance-eating lope. He had
      stolen a horse, and that meant death if they caught him. He loosened his
      gaudy kerchief and gulped in fear, not of what pursued, but of what was
      miles before him. His own saddle, strapped behind the one he sat in,
      bumped against him with each reach of the horse and had already made his
      back sore&mdash;but he must endure it for a time. Never in all his life
      had minutes been so precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passed and the horse seemed to be doing well, much better
      than he had hoped&mdash;he would rest it for a few minutes at the next
      water while he drank his fill and changed the bumping saddle. As he
      rounded a turn and entered a heavily grassed valley he saw a stream close
      at hand and, leaping off, fixed the saddle first. As he knelt to drink he
      caught a movement and jumped up to catch his mount. Time after time he
      almost touched it, but it evaded him and kept up the game, cropping a
      mouthful of grass during each respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he muttered as he let it eat. &ldquo;I'll get my drink while you
      eat an' then I'll get you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt by the stream again and drank long and deep. As he paused for
      breath something made him leap up and to one side, reaching for his Colt
      at the same instant. His fingers found only leather and he swore fiercely
      as he remembered&mdash;he had sold the Colt for food and kept the rifle
      for defence. As he faced the rear a horseman rounded the turn and the
      fugitive, wheeling, dashed for the stolen horse forty yards away, where
      his rifle lay in its saddle sheath. But an angry command and the sharp hum
      of a bullet fired in front of him checked his flight and he stopped short
      and swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon the jig's up,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Cassidy, balancing the up-raised
      Colt with nicety and indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea; I reckon so,&rdquo; sullenly replied the other, tears running into his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm damned!&rdquo; snorted Hopalong with cutting contempt. &ldquo;Crying like a
      li'l baby! Got nerve enough to steal my cayuse, an' then go an' beller
      like a lost calf when I catch you. Yo're a fine specimen of a hoss-thief,
      I don't think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're a liar!&rdquo; retorted the other, clenching his fists and growing red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy's mouth opened and then clicked shut as his Colt swung down.
      But he did not shoot; something inside of him held his trigger finger and
      he swore instead. The idea of a man stealing his horse, being caught
      red-handed and unarmed, and still possessed of sufficient courage to call
      his captor a name never tolerated or overlooked in that country! And the
      idea that he, Hopalong Cassidy, of the Bar-20, could not shoot such a
      thief! &ldquo;Damn that sky pilot! He's shore gone an' made me loco,&rdquo; he
      muttered, savagely, and then addressed his prisoner. &ldquo;Oh, you ain't
      crying? Wind got in yore eyes, I reckon, an' sort of made 'em leak a
      little&mdash;that it? Or mebby them unholy green roses an' yaller grass on
      that blasted fool neck-kerchief of yourn are too much for <i>your</i>
      eyes, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look ahere!&rdquo; snapped the man on the ground, stepping forward, one fist
      upraised. &ldquo;I came nigh onto licking you this noon in that gospel sharp's
      tent for making fun of that scarf, an' I'll do it yet if you get any smart
      about it! You mind yore own business an' close yore fool eyes if you don't
      like my clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! You ain't no cry-baby after all. Hanged if I even think yo're a real
      genuine hoss-thief!&rdquo; enthused Mr. Cassidy. &ldquo;You act like a twin brother;
      but what the devil ever made you steal that cayuse, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's none of yore business, neither; but I'll tell you, just the
      same,&rdquo; replied the thief. &ldquo;I had to have it; that's why. I'll fight you
      rough-an'-tumble to see if I keep it, or if you take the cayuse an' shoot
      me besides: is it a go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong stared at him and then a grin struggled for life, got it, and
      spread slowly over his tanned countenance. &ldquo;Yore gall is refreshing!
      Damned if it ain't worse than the scarf. Here, you tell me what made you
      take a chance like stealing a cayuse this noon&mdash;I'm getting to like
      you, bad as you are, hanged if I ain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what's the use?&rdquo; demanded the other, tears again coming into his
      eyes. &ldquo;You'll think I'm lying an' trying to crawl out&mdash;an' I won't do
      neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> didn't say <i>you</i> was a liar,&rdquo; replied Hopalong. &ldquo;It was the
      other way about. Reckon you can try me, anyhow; can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I s'pose so,&rdquo; responded the other, slowly, and in a milder tone of
      voice. &ldquo;An' when I called you that I was mad and desperate. I was hasty&mdash;you
      see, my wife's dying, or dead, over in Winchester. I was riding hard to
      get to her before it was too late when my cayuse stepped into a hole just
      the other side of Grant&mdash;you know what happened. I shot the animal,
      stripped off my saddle an' hoofed it to town, an' dropped into that gospel
      dealer's layout to see if he could make me feel any better&mdash;which he
      could not. I just couldn't stand his palaver about death an' slipped out.
      I was going to lay for you an' lick you for the way you acted about this
      scarf&mdash;had to do something or go loco. But when I got outside there
      was yore cayuse, all saddled an' ready to go. I just up an' threw my
      saddle on it, followed suit with myself an' was ten miles out of town
      before I realized just what I'd done. But the realizing part of it didn't
      make no difference to me&mdash;I'd 'a' done it just the same if I had
      stopped to think it over. That's flat, an' straight. I've got to get to
      that li'l woman as quick as I can, an' I'd steal all the cayuses in the
      whole damned country if they'd do me any good. That's all of it&mdash;take
      it or leave it. I put it up to you. That's yore cayuse, but you ain't
      going to get it without fighting me for it! If you shoot me down without
      giving me a chance, all right! I'll cut a throat for that wore-out bronc!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong was buried in thought and came to himself just in time to cover
      the other and stop him not six feet away. &ldquo;Just a minute, before you make
      me shoot you! I want to think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn that gun!&rdquo; swore the fugitive, nervously shifting his feet and
      preparing to spring. &ldquo;We'd 'a' been fighting by this time if it wasn't for
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stand still or I'll blow you apart,&rdquo; retorted Hopalong, grimly. &ldquo;A
      man's got a right to think, ain't he? An' if I had somebody here to mind
      these guns so you couldn't sneak 'em on me I'd fight you so blamed quick
      that you'd be licked before you knew you was at it. But we ain't going to
      fight&mdash;<i>stand still</i>! You ain't got no show at all when yo're
      dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you gimme that cayuse&mdash;my God, man! Do you know the hell I've
      been through for the last two days? Got the word up at Daly's Crossing an'
      ain't slept since. I'll go loco if the strain lasts much longer! She
      asking for me, begging to see me: an' me, like a damned idiot, wasting
      time out here talking to another. Ride with me, behind me&mdash;it's only
      forty miles more&mdash;tie me to the saddle an' blow me to pieces if you
      find I'm lying&mdash;do anything you wants; but let me get to Winchester
      before dark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong was watching him closely and at the end of the other's outburst
      threw back his head. &ldquo;I reckon I'm a plain fool, a jackass; but I don't
      care. I'll rope that cayuse for you. You come along to save time,&rdquo;
       Hopalong ordered, spurring forward. His borrowed rope sailed out,
      tightened, and in a moment he was working at the saddle. &ldquo;Here, you; I'm
      going to swamp mounts with you&mdash;this one is fresher an' faster.&rdquo; He
      had his own saddle off and the other on in record time, and stepped back.
      &ldquo;There; don't stand there like a fool&mdash;wake up an' hustle! I might
      change my mind&mdash;that's the way to move! Gimme that neck-kerchief for
      a souveneer, an' get out. Send that cayuse back to Dave Wilkes, at Grant&mdash;it's
      hissn. Don't thank me; just gimme that scarf an' ride like the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, already mounted, tore the kerchief from his throat and handed
      it quickly to his benefactor. &ldquo;If you ever want a man to take you out of
      hell, send to Winchester for Ben Ferris&mdash;that's me. So long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy sat on his saddle where he had dropped it after making the
      exchange and looked after the galloping horseman, and when a distant rise
      had shut him from sight, turned his eyes on the scarf in his hand and
      cogitated. Finally, with a long-drawn sigh he arose, and, placing the
      scarf on the ground, caught and saddled his horse. Riding gloomily back to
      where the riot of color fluttered on the grass he drew his Colt and sent
      six bullets through it with a great amount of satisfaction. Not content
      with the damage he had inflicted, he leaned over and swooped it up. Riding
      further he also swooped up a stone and tied the kerchief around it, and
      then stood up in his stirrups and drew back his arm with critical
      judgment. He sat quietly for a time after the gaudy missile had
      disappeared into the stream and then, wheeling, cantered away. But he did
      not return to the town of Grant&mdash;he lacked the nerve to face Dave
      Wilkes and tell his childish and improbable story. He would ride on and
      meet Red as they had agreed; a letter would do for Mr. Wilkes, and after
      he had broken the shock in that manner he could pay him a personal visit
      sometime soon. Dave would never believe the story and when it was told
      Hopalong wanted to have the value of the horse in his trousers pocket. Of
      course, Ben Ferris <i>might</i> have told the truth and he might return
      the horse according to directions. Hopalong emerged from his reverie long
      enough to appeal to his mount:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bronc, I've been thinking: am I or am I not a jackass?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RED BRINGS TROUBLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      After a night spent on the plain and a cigarette for his breakfast,
      Hopalong, grouchy and hungry, rode slowly to the place appointed for his
      meeting with Red, but Mr. Connors was over two hours late. It was now
      mid-forenoon and Hopalong occupied his time for a while by riding out
      fancy designs on the sand; but he soon tired of this makeshift diversion
      and grew petulant. Red's tardiness was all the worse because the erring
      party to the agreement had turned in his saddle at Hoyt's Corners and
      loosed a flippant and entirely uncalled-for remark about his friend's
      ideas regarding appointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that red-headed Romeo is shore late this time,&rdquo; Hopalong muttered.
      &ldquo;Why don't he find a girl closer to home, anyhow? Thank the Lord I ain't
      got no use for shell games of any kind. Here I am, without anything to eat
      an' no prospects of anything, sitting up on this locoed layout like a sore
      thumb, an' can't move without hitting myself! An' it'll be late to-day
      before I can get any grub, too. Oh, well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I ain't in love, so
      things might be a whole lot worse with me. An' he ain't in love, neither,
      only he won't listen to reason. He gets mad an' calls me a sage hen an'
      says I'm stuck on myself because some fool told me I had brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he pictured the object of his friend's affections. &ldquo;Huh;
      anybody that got one good, square look at her wouldn't ever accuse him of
      having brains. But he'll forget her in a month. That was the life of his
      last hobbling fit an' it was the worst he ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grinning at his friend's peculiarly human characteristics he leaned back
      in the saddle and felt for tobacco and papers. As he finished pouring the
      chopped alfalfa into the paper he glanced up and saw a mounted man top the
      sky-line of the distant hills and shoot down the slope at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed it: started three hours late an' now he's trying to make it up
      in the last mile,&rdquo; Hopalong muttered, dexterously spreading the tobacco
      along the groove and quickly rolling the cigarette. Lighting it he looked
      up again and saw that the horseman was wildly waving a sombrero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Wigwagging for forgiveness,&rdquo; laughed the man who waited. &ldquo;Old
      son-of-a-gun, I'd wait a week if I had some grub, an' he knows it.
      Couldn't get mad at him if I tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Connors' antics now became frantic and he shouted something at the top
      of his voice. His friend spurred his mount. &ldquo;Come on, bronc; wake up. His
      girl said 'yes' an' now he wants me to get him out of his trouble.&rdquo;
       Whereupon he jogged forward. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he shouted, sitting up very
      straight. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red energetically swept the sombrero behind him and pointed to the rear.
      &ldquo;War-whoops! W-a-r w-h-o-o-p-s! Injuns, you chump!&rdquo; Mr. Connors appeared
      to be mildly exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; sarcastically rejoined Mr. Cassidy in his throat, and then shouted
      in reply: &ldquo;Love an' liquor don't mix very well in you. Wake up! Come out
      of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's straight&mdash;I mean it!&rdquo; cried Mr. Connors, close enough now to
      save the remainder of his lungs. &ldquo;It's a bunch of young bucks on their
      first war-trail, I reckon. 'T ain't Geronimo, all right; I wouldn't be
      here now if it was. Three of 'em chased me an' the two that are left are
      coming hot-foot somewhere the other side of them hills. They act sort of
      mad, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby they ain't acting at all,&rdquo; cheerily replied his companion. &ldquo;An'
      then that's the way you got that graze?&rdquo; pointing to a bloody furrow on
      Mr. Connors' cheek. &ldquo;But just the same it looks like the trail left by a
      woman's finger nail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finger nail nothing,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Connors, flushing a little. &ldquo;But, for
      God's sake, are you going to sit here like a wart on a dead dog an' wait
      for 'em?&rdquo; he demanded with a rising inflection. &ldquo;Do you reckon yo're
      running a dance, or a party, or something like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; placidly inquired Mr. Cassidy, gazing intently towards the
      high sky-line of the distant hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;an' I won't tell you again, neither!&rdquo; snapped the owner of the
      furrowed cheek. &ldquo;The others are 'way behind now&mdash;but we're standing
      <i>still</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you say there was others?&rdquo; reproved Hopalong. &ldquo;Naturally I
      didn't see no use of getting all het up just because two sprouted papooses
      feel like crowding us a bit; it wouldn't be none of <i>our</i> funeral,
      would it?&rdquo; and the indignant Mr. Cassidy hurriedly dismounted and hid his
      horse in a nearby chaparral and returned to his companion at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, gimme yore Winchester an' then hustle on for a ways, have an
      accident, fall off yore cayuse, an' act scared to death, if you know how.
      It's that little trick Buck told us about, an' it shore ought to work fine
      here. We'll see if two infant feather-dusters can lick the Bar-20. Get
      a-going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They traded rifles, Hopalong taking the repeater in place of the
      single-shot gun he carried, and Red departed as bidden, his face gradually
      breaking into an enthusiastic grin as he ruminated upon the plan.
      &ldquo;Level-headed old cuss; he's a wonder when it comes to planning or
      fighting. An' lucky,&mdash;well, I reckon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong ran forward for a short distance and slid down the steep bank of
      a narrow arroyo and waited, the repeater thrust out through the dense
      fringe of grass and shrubs which bordered the edge. When settled to his
      complete satisfaction and certain that he was effectually screened from
      the sight of any one in front of him, he arose on his toes and looked
      around for his companion, and laughed. Mr. Connors was bending very
      dejectedly apparently over his prostrate horse, but in reality was
      swearing heartily at the ignorant quadruped because it strove with might
      and main to get its master's foot off its head so it could arise. The man
      in the arroyo turned again and watched the hills and it was not long
      before he saw two Indians burst into view over the crest and gallop
      towards his friend. They were not to be blamed because they did not know
      the pursued had joined a friend, for the second trail was yet some
      distance in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pair of budding warriors, all right; an' awful important. Somebody must
      'a' told <i>them</i> they had brains,&rdquo; Mr. Cassidy muttered. &ldquo;They're just
      at the age when they knows it all an' have to go 'round raising hell all
      the time. Wonder when they jumped the reservation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indians, seeing Mr. Connors arguing with his prostrate horse, and
      taking it for granted that he was not stopping for pleasure or to view the
      scenery, let out a yell and dashed ahead at grater speed, at the same time
      separating so as to encircle him and attack him front and rear at the same
      time. They had a great amount of respect for cowboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manoeuvre was entirely unexpected and clashed violently with Mr.
      Cassidy's plan of procedure, so two irate punchers swore heartily at their
      rank stupidity in not counting on it. Of course everybody that knew
      anything at all about such warfare knew that they would do just such a
      thing, which made it all the more bitter. But Red had cultivated the habit
      of thinking quickly and he saw at once that the remedy lay with him; he
      astonished the exultant savages by straddling his disgruntled horse as it
      scrambled to its feet and galloping away from them, bearing slightly to
      the south, because he wished to lure his pursuers to ride closer to his
      anxious and eager friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      This action was a success, for the yelling warriors, slowing perceptibly
      because of their natural astonishment at the resurrection and speed of an
      animal regarded as dead or useless, spurred on again, drawing closer
      together, and along the chord of the arc made by Mr. Connors' trail.
      Evidently the fool white man was either crazy or had original and
      startling ideas about the way to rest a horse when hard pressed, which
      pleased them much, since he had lost so much time. The pleasures of the
      war-trail would be vastly greater if all white men had similar ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong, the light of fighting burning strong in his eyes, watched them
      sweep nearer and nearer, splendid examples of their type and seeming to be
      a part of their mounts. Then two shots rang out in quick succession and a
      cloud of pungent smoke arose lazily from the edge of the arroyo as the
      warriors fell from their mounts not sixty yards from the hidden marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Connors' rifle spat fire once to make assurance doubly sure and he
      hastily rejoined his friend as that person climbed out of the arroyo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! They must have been half-breeds!&rdquo; snorted Red in great disgust,
      watching his friend shed sand from his clothes. &ldquo;I allus opined that
      'Paches was too blamed slick to bite on a game like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they are purty 'lusive animals, 'Paches; but there are exceptions,&rdquo;
       replied Hopalong, smiling at the success of their scheme. &ldquo;Them two ain't
      'Paches&mdash;they're the exceptions. But let me tell you that's a good
      game, just the same. It is as long as they don't see the second trail in
      time. Didn't Buck and Skinny get two that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon so. But what'll we do now? What's the next play?&rdquo; asked
      Red, hurriedly, his eyes searching the sky-line of the hills. &ldquo;The rest of
      the coyotes will be here purty soon, an' they'll be madder than ever now.
      An' you better gimme back that gun, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take yore old gun&mdash;who wants the blamed thing, anyhow?&rdquo; Hopalong
      demanded, throwing the weapon at his friend as he ran to bring up the
      hidden horse. When he returned he grinned pleasantly. &ldquo;Why, we'll go on
      like we was greased for calamity, that's what we'll do. Did you reckon we
      was going to play leap-frog around here an' wait for the rest of them
      paint-shops, like a blamed fool pair of idiots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know what <i>you</i> might do, remembering how you acted when I
      met you,&rdquo; retorted Red, shifting his cartridge belt so the empty loops
      were behind and out of the way. &ldquo;But I shore knowed what we ought to do,
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mebby you also know how many's headed this way; do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got me stumped there; but there's a round dozen, anyway,&rdquo; Red
      replied. &ldquo;You see, the three that chased me were out scouting ahead of the
      main bunch; an' I didn't have no time to take no blasted census.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we've got to hit the home trail, an' hit it hard. Wind up that
      four-laigged excuse of yourn, an' take my dust,&rdquo; Hopalong responded,
      leading the way. &ldquo;If we can get home there'll be a lot of disgusted braves
      hitting the high spots on the back trail trying to find a way out. Buck
      an' the rest of the boys will be a whole lot pleased, too. We can muster
      thirty men in two hours if we gets to Buckskin, an' that's twenty more
      than we'll need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you one thing, Hoppy; we can get as far as Powers' old ranch house,
      an' that's shore,&rdquo; replied Red, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exploded his companion in scorn and pity. &ldquo;That old sieve of a
      shack ain't good enough for <i>me</i> to die in, no matter what you think
      about it. Why, it's as full of holes as a stiff hat in a melee. Yo're on
      the wrong trail; think again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy objected not because he believed that Powers' old ranch house
      was unworthy of serious consideration as a place of refuge and defence,
      but for the reason that he wished to reach Buckskin so his friends might
      all get in on the treat. Times were very dull on the ranch, and this was
      an occasion far too precious to let slip by. Besides, he then would have
      the pleasure of leading his friends against the enemy and battling on even
      terms. If he sought shelter he and Red would have to fight on the
      defensive, which was a game he hated cordially because it put him in a
      relatively subordinate position and thereby hurt his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you that it's a whole lot better than thin air with a
      hard-working circle around us&mdash;an' you know what that means,&rdquo;
       retorted Mr. Connors. &ldquo;But if you don't want to take a chance in the
      shack, why mebby we can make Wallace's, or the Cross-O-Cross. That is, if
      we don't get turned out of our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't head for no Cross-O-Cross or Wallace's,&rdquo; rejoined his friend
      with emphasis, &ldquo;an' we won't waste no time in Powers' shack, neither;
      we'll push right through as hard as we can go for Buckskin. Let them
      fellers find their own hunting&mdash;our outfit comes first. An' besides
      that'll mean a detour in a country fine for ambushes. We'd never get
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have it yore own way, then!&rdquo; snapped Red. &ldquo;You allus was a
      hard-headed old mule, anyhow.&rdquo; In his heart Red knew that Hopalong was
      right about Wallace's and the Cross-O-Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after the two punchers had quitted the scene of their trap,
      several Apaches loped up, read the story of the tragedy at a glance, and
      galloped on in pursuit. They had left the reservation a fortnight before
      under the able leadership of that veteran of many war-trails&mdash;Black
      Bear. Their leader, chafing at inaction and sick of the monotony of
      reservation life, had yielded to the entreaties of a score of restless
      young men and slipped away at their head, eager for the joys of raiding
      and plundering. But instead of stealing horses and murdering isolated
      whites as they had expected, they met with heavy repulses and were now
      without the mind of their leader. They had fled from one defeat to another
      and twice had barely eluded the cavalry which pursued them. Now two more
      of their dwindling force were dead and another had been found but an hour
      before. Rage and ferocity seethed in each savage heart and they determined
      to get the puncher they had chased, and that other whose trail they now
      saw for the first time. They would place at least one victory against the
      string of their defeats, and at any cost. Whips rose and fell and the
      war-party shot forward in a compact group, two scouts thrown ahead to feel
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red and Hopalong rode on rejoicing, for there were three less Apaches
      loose in the Southwest for the inhabitants to swear about and fear, and
      there was an excellent chance of more to follow. The Southwest had no
      toleration for the Government's policy of dealing with Indians and derived
      a great amount of satisfaction every time an Apache was killed. It still
      clung to the time-honored belief that the only good Indian was a dead one.
      Mr. Cassidy voiced his elation and then rubbed an empty stomach in vain
      regret,&mdash;when a bullet shrilled past his head, so unexpectedly as to
      cause him to duck instinctively and then glance apologetically at his
      red-haired friend; and both spurred their mounts to greater speed. Next
      Mr. Connors grabbed frantically at his perforated sombrero and grew
      petulant and loquacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both them shots was lucky, Hoppy; the feller that fired at me did it on
      the dead run; but that won't help us none if one of 'em connects with us.
      You gimme that Sharps&mdash;got to show 'em that they're taking big
      chances crowding us this way.&rdquo; He took the heavy rifle and turned in the
      saddle. &ldquo;It's an even thousand, if it's a yard. He don't look very big,
      can't hardly tell him from his cayuse; an' the wind's puffy. Why don't you
      dirty or rust this gun? The sun glitters all along the barrel. Well, here
      goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed by a mile,&rdquo; reproved Hopalong, who would have been stunned by such
      a thing as a hit under the circumstances, even if his good-shooting friend
      had made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Missed the coyote I aimed for, but I got the cayuse of his off
      pardner; see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk about luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right: it takes blamed good shooting to miss that close in
      this case. Look! It's slowed 'em up a bit, an' that's about all I hoped to
      do. Bet they think I'm a real, shore-'nuff medicine-man. Now gimme another
      cartridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not; no use wasting lead at this range. We'll need all the
      cartridges we got before we get out of this hole. You can't do nothing
      without stopping&mdash;an' that takes time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll stop! The blazes with the time! Gimme another, d'ye hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy heard, complied, and stopped beside his companion, who was
      very intent upon the matter at hand. It took some figuring to make a hit
      when the range was so great and the sun so blinding and the wind so
      capricious. He lowered the rifle and peered through the smoke at the
      confusion he had caused by dropping the nearest warrior. He was said to be
      the best rifle shot in the Southwest, which means a great deal, and his
      enemies did not deny it. But since the Sharps shot a special cartridge and
      was reliable up to the limit of its sight gauge, a matter of eighteen
      hundred yards, he did not regard the hit as anything worthy of especial
      mention. Not so his friend, who grinned joyously and loosed his
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're a shore wonder with that gun, Red! Why don't you lose that repeater
      an' get a gun like mine? Lord, if I could use a rifle like you, I wouldn't
      have that gun of yourn for a gift. Just look at what you did with it!
      Please get one like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm plumb satisfied with the repeater,&rdquo; replied Red. &ldquo;I don't miss very
      often at eight hundred with it, an' that's long enough range for most
      anybody. An' if I do miss, I can send another that won't, an' right on the
      tail of the first, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the devil! You make me disgusted with yore fool talk about that
      carbine!&rdquo; snapped his companion, and the subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merits of their respective rifles had always been a bone of contention
      between them and one well chewed, at that. Red was very well satisfied
      with his Winchester, and he was a good judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did stop 'em a little,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Cassidy some time later when he
      looked back. &ldquo;You stopped 'em coming straight, but they're spreading out
      to work up around us. Now, if we had good cayuses instead of these wooden
      wonders, we could run away from 'em dead easy, draw their best mounted
      warriors to the front an' then close with 'em. Good thing their cayuses
      are well tired out, for as it is we've got to make a stand purty soon.
      Gee! They don't like you, Red; they're calling you names in the sign
      language. Just look at 'em cuss you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much water have you got?&rdquo; inquired his friend with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canteen plumb full. How're you fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got the same, less one drink. That gives us enough for a couple of days
      with some to spare, if we're careful,&rdquo; Mr. Connors replied. New Mexican
      canteens are built on generous lines and are known as life-preservers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that glory-hunter go!&rdquo; exclaimed Red, watching a brave who was
      riding half a mile to their right and rapidly coming abreast of them.
      &ldquo;Wonder how he got over there without us seeing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here; stop him!&rdquo; suggested Hopalong, holding out his Sharps. &ldquo;We can't
      let him get ahead of us and lay in ambush&mdash;that's what he's playing
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gun's good, and better, for me, at this range; but you know, I can't
      hit a jack-rabbit going over rough country as fast as that feller is,&rdquo;
       replied his companion, standing up in his stirrups and firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Never touched him! But he's edging off a-plenty. See him cuss you.
      What's he calling you, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, shut up! How the devil do <i>I</i> know? I don't talk with my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you superstitious, Red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Shut up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am. See that feller over there? If he gets in front of us it's a
      shore sign that somebody's going to get hurt. He'll have plenty of time to
      get cover an' pick us off as we come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry&mdash;his cayuse is deader'n ours. They must 'a' been
      pushing on purty hard the last few days. See it stumble?&mdash;what'd I
      tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they're gaining on us slow but shore. We've got to make a stand
      purty soon&mdash;how much further do you reckon that infernal shack is,
      anyhow?&rdquo; Hopalong asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'T ain't fur off&mdash;see it any minute now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; remarked Hopalong, holding out his rifle, &ldquo;stencil yore mark on
      his hide; catch him just as he strikes the top of that little rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't got time&mdash;that shack can't be much further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it wasn't, for as they galloped over a rise they saw, half a mile
      ahead of them, an adobe building in poor state of preservation. It was
      Powers' old ranch house, and as they neared it, they saw that there was no
      doubt about the holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you it was a sieve,&rdquo; grunted Hopalong, swinging in on the tail of
      his companion. &ldquo;Not worth a hang for anything,&rdquo; he added bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll answer, all right,&rdquo; retorted Red grimly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. HOLDEN DROPS IN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy dismounted and viewed the building with open disgust, walking
      around it to see what held it up, and when he finally realized that it was
      self-supporting his astonishment was profound. Undoubtedly there were
      shacks in the United States in worse condition, but he hoped their number
      was small. Of course he knew that the building was small. Of course he
      knew that the building would make a very good place of defence, but for
      the sake of argument he called to his companion and urged that they be
      satisfied with what defence they could extemporize in the open. Mr.
      Connors hotly and hastily dissented as he led the horses into the
      building, and straightway the subject was arbitrated with much feeling and
      snappy eloquence. Finally Hopalong thought that Red was a chump, and said
      so out loud, whereat Red said unpleasant things about his good friend's
      pedigree, attributes, intelligence, et al., even going so far as to
      prognosticate his friend's place of eternal abode. The remarks were fast
      getting to be somewhat personal in tenor when a whine in the air swept up
      the scale to a vicious shriek as it passed between them, dropped rapidly
      to a whine again and quickly died out in the distance, a flat report
      coming to their ears a few seconds later. Invisible bees seemed to be
      winging through the air, the angry and venomous droning becoming more
      pronounced each passing moment, and the irregular cracking of rifles grew
      louder rapidly. An angry <i>s-p-a-t!</i> told of where a stone behind them
      had launched the ricochet which hurled skyward with a wheezing scream. A
      handful of 'dobe dust sprang from the corner of the building and sifted
      down upon them, causing Red to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ricochet was a Sharps!&rdquo; exclaimed Hopalong, and they lost no time in
      getting into the building, where the discussion was renewed as they
      prepared for the final struggle. Red grunted his cheerful approval, for
      now he was out of the blazing sun and where he could better appreciate the
      musical tones of the flying bullets; but his companion, slamming shut the
      door and propping it with a fallen roof-beam, grumbled and finally gave
      rein to his rancor by sneering at the Winchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shore gets me that after all I have said about that gun you will tote
      it around with you and force yoreself into a suicide's grave,&rdquo; quoth Mr.
      Cassidy, with exuberant pugnacity. &ldquo;I ain't in no way objecting to the
      suicide part of it, but I can't see that it's at all fair to drag <i>me</i>
      onto the edge of everlasting eternity with you. If you ain't got no regard
      for yore own life you shore ought to think a little about yore friend's.
      Now you'll waste all yore cartridges an' then come snooping around me to
      borrow my gun. Why don't you lose the damned thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I pack ain't none of yore business, which same I'll uphold,&rdquo;
       retorted Mr. Connors, at last able to make himself heard. &ldquo;You get over on
      yore own side an' use yore Colt; I've wondered a whole lot where you ever
      got the sense to use a Colt&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn't be a heap surprised to
      see you toting a pearl-handled .22, like the kids use. Now you 'tend to
      yore grave-yard aspirants, an' lemme do the same with mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord knows I've stood a whole lot from you because you just can't
      help being foolish, but I've got plumb weary and sick of it. It stops
      right here or you won't get no 'Paches,&rdquo; snorted Hopalong, peering
      intently through a hole in the shack. The more they squabbled the better
      they liked it,&mdash;controversies had become so common that they were
      merely a habit; and they served to take the grimness out of desperate
      situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you can't lick one side of me,&rdquo; averred Red loftily. &ldquo;You never did
      stop anybody that was anything,&rdquo; he jeered as he fired from his window.
      &ldquo;Why, you couldn't even hit the bottom of the Grand Canyon if you leaned
      over the edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could, if you leaned too far, you red-headed wart of a half-breed,&rdquo;
       snapped Hopalong. &ldquo;But how about the Joneses, Tarantula Charley, Slim
      Travennes, an' all the rest? How about them, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! You couldn't 'a' got any of 'em if they had been sober,&rdquo; and Mr.
      Connors shook so with mirth that the Indian at whom he had fired got away
      with a whole skin and cheerfully derided the marksman. &ldquo;That 'Pache shore
      reckons it was you shooting at him, I missed him so far. Now, you shut up&mdash;I
      want to get some so we can go home. I don't want to stay out here all
      night an' the next day as well,&rdquo; Red grumbled, his words dying slowly in
      his throat as he voiced other thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong caught sight of an Apache who moved cautiously through a
      chaparral lying about nine hundred yards away. As long as the distant
      enemy lay quietly he could not be discerned, but he was not content with
      assured safety and took a chance. Hopalong raised his rifle to his
      shoulder as the Indian fired and the latter's bullet, striking the edge of
      the hole through which Mr. Cassidy peered, kicked up a generous handful of
      dust, some of which found lodgment in that individual's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow!&rdquo; yelled the unfortunate, dancing blindly around the room
      in rage and pain, and dropping his rifle to grab at his eyes. &ldquo;Oh! Oh!
      Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion wheeled like a flash and grabbed him as he stumbled past.
      &ldquo;Are you plugged bad, Hoppy? Where did they get you? Are you hit bad?&rdquo; and
      Red's heart was in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain't plugged bad!&rdquo; mimicked Hopalong. &ldquo;I ain't plugged at all!&rdquo; he
      blazed, kicking enthusiastically at his solicitous friend. &ldquo;Get me some
      water, you jackass! Don't stand there like a fool! I ain't going to fall
      down. Don't you know my eyes are full of 'dobe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red, avoiding another kick, hastily complied, and as hastily left Mr.
      Cassidy to wash out the dirt while he returned to his post by the window.
      &ldquo;Anybody'd think you was full of red-eye, the way you act,&rdquo; muttered Red
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong, rubbing his eyes of the dirt, went back to the hole in the wall
      and looked out. &ldquo;Hey, Red! Come over here an' spill that brave's conceit.
      I can't keep my eyes open long enough to aim, an' it's a nice shot, too.
      It'd serve him right if you got him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Connors obeyed the summons and peered out cautiously. &ldquo;I can't see
      him, nohow; where is the coyote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there in that little chaparral; see him now? <i>There!</i> See him
      moving. Do you mean to tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep; I see him, all right. You watch,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He's just over
      nine hundred&mdash;where's yore Sharps?&rdquo; He took the weapon, glanced at
      the Buffington sight, which he found to be set right, and aimed carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong blinked through another hole as his friend fired and saw the
      Indian flop down and crawl aimlessly about on hands and knees. &ldquo;What's he
      doing now, Red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing marbles, you chump; an' here goes for his agate,&rdquo; replied the man
      with the Sharps, firing again. &ldquo;There! Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as a bullet
      hummed in through the window he had quitted for the moment, and thudded
      into the wall, making the dry adobe fly. It had missed him by only a few
      inches and he now crept along the floor to the rear of the room and shoved
      his rifle out among the branches of a stunted mesquite which grew before a
      fissure in the wall. &ldquo;You keep away from that windy for a minute, Hoppy,&rdquo;
       he warned as he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terror-stricken lizard flashed out of the fissure and along the wall
      where the roof had fallen in and flitted into a hole, while a fly buzzed
      loudly and hovered persistently around Red's head, to the rage of that
      individual. &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; he grunted, lowering the rifle and peering through
      the smoke. A yell reached his ears and he forthwith returned to his
      window, whistling softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Mr. Cassidy's eyes were better and his temper sweeter, for he
      hummed &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; and then jumped to &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo; mixing the two airs
      with careless impartiality, which was a sign that he was thinking deeply.
      &ldquo;Wonder what ever became of Powers, Red. Peculiar feller, he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In jail, I reckon, if drink hasn't killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I reckon so,&rdquo; and Mr. Cassidy continued his medley, which prompted
      his friend quickly to announce his unqualified disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make more of a mess of them two songs than anybody I ever heard
      murder 'em! <i>Shut up!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and the concert stopped, the vocalist
      venting his feelings at an Indian, and killing the horse instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get him?&rdquo; queried Red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope; but I got his cayuse,&rdquo; Hopalong replied, shoving a fresh cartridge
      into the foul, greasy breech of the Sharps. &ldquo;An' here's where I get him&mdash;got
      to square up for my eyes some way,&rdquo; he muttered, firing. &ldquo;Missed! Now what
      do you think of that!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better take my Winchester,&rdquo; suggested Red, in a matter-of-fact way, but
      he chuckled softly and listened for the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you go to the devil!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Cassidy, firing again. &ldquo;Whoop! Got
      him that time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked his companion, with strong suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of yore business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, darn it! Who spilled the water?&rdquo; yelled Red, staring blankly at the
      overturned canteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! Reckon I did, Red,&rdquo; apologized his friend ruefully. &ldquo;Now of all
      the cussed luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well; we've got another, an' you had to wash out yore eyes. Lucky we
      each had one&mdash;<i>Holy smoke!</i> It's most all gone! The top is
      loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heartfelt profanity filled the room and the two disgusted punchers went
      sullenly back to their posts. It was a calamity of no small magnitude,
      for, while food could be dispensed with for a long time if necessary,
      going without water was another question. It was as necessary as
      cartridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hopalong laughed at the ludicrous side of the whole affair, thereby
      revealing one of the characteristics which endeared him to his friends. No
      matter how desperate a situation might be, he could always find in it
      something at which to laugh. He laughed going into danger and coming out
      of it, with a joke or a pleasantry always trembling on the end of his
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, did it ever strike you how cussed thirsty a feller gets just as soon
      as he knows he can't have no drink? But it don't make much difference,
      nohow. We'll get out of this little scrape just as we've allus got out of
      trouble. There's some mad war-whoops outside that are worse off than we
      are, because they are at the wrong end of yore gun. I feel sort of sorry
      for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're shore a happy idiot,&rdquo; grinned Red. &ldquo;Hey! Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Galloping was heard and Hopalong, running to the door, looked out through
      a crack as sudden firing broke out around the rear of the shack, and fell
      to pulling away the props, crying, &ldquo;It's a puncher, Red; he's riding this
      way! Come on an' help him in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a blamed fool to ride this way! I'm with you!&rdquo; replied Red, running
      to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile from the house, coming across the open space as fast as he
      could urge his horse, rode a cowboy, and not far behind him raced about a
      dozen Apaches, yelling and firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red picked up his companion's rifle, and steadying it against the jamb of
      the door, fired, dropping one of the foremost of the pursuers. Quickly
      reloading again, he fired and missed. The third shot struck another horse,
      and then taking up his own gun he began to fire rapidly, as rapidly as he
      could work the lever and yet make his shots tell. Hopalong drew his Colt
      and ran back to watch the rear of the house, and it was well that he did
      so, for an Apache in that direction, believing that the trapped punchers
      were so busily engaged with the new developments as to forget for the
      moment, sprinted towards the back window; and he had gotten within twenty
      paces of the goal when Hopalong's Colt cracked a protest. Seeing that the
      warrior was no longer a combatant, Mr. Cassidy ran back to the door just
      as the stranger fell from his horse and crawled past Red. The door slammed
      shut, the props fell against it, and the two friends turned to the work of
      driving back the second band, which, however, had given up all hope of
      rushing the house in the face of Red's telling fire, and had sought cover
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger dragged himself to the canteens and drank what little water
      remained, and then turned to watch the two men moving from place to place,
      firing coolly and methodically. He thought he recognized one of them from
      the descriptions he had heard, but he was not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Holden,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, but the cracking of the rifles
      drowned his voice. During a lull he tried again. &ldquo;My name's Holden,&rdquo; he
      repeated weakly. &ldquo;I'm from the Cross-O-Cross, an' can't get back there
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine's Cassidy, an' that's Connors, of the Bar-20. Are you hurt very
      bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not very bad,&rdquo; lied Holden, trying to smile. &ldquo;Gee, but I'm glad I
      fell in with you two fellers,&rdquo; he exclaimed. He was but little more than a
      boy, and to him Hopalong Cassidy and Red Connors were names with which to
      conjure. &ldquo;But I'm plumb sorry I went an' brought you more trouble,&rdquo; he
      added regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! We had it before you came&mdash;you needn't do no worrying
      about that, Holden; besides, I reckon you couldn't help it,&rdquo; Hopalong
      grinned facetiously. &ldquo;But tell us how you came to mix up with that bunch,&rdquo;
       he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden shuddered and hesitated a moment, his companions alertly shifting
      from crack to crack, window to window, their rifles cracking at intervals.
      They appeared to him to act as if they had done nothing else all their
      lives but fight Indians from that shack, and he braced up a little at
      their example of coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an awful story, awful!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I was riding towards Hoyt's
      Corners an' when I got about half way there I topped a rise an' saw a
      nester's house about half a mile away. It wasn't there the last time I
      rode that way, an' it looked so peaceful an' home-like that I stopped an'
      looked at it a few minutes. I was just going to start again when that
      war-party rode out of a barranca close to the house an' went straight for
      it at top speed. It seemed like a dream, 'cause I thought Apaches never
      got so far east. They don't, do they? I thought not&mdash;these must 'a'
      got turned out of their way an' had to hustle for safety. Well, it was all
      over purty quick. I saw 'em drag out two women an'&mdash;an'&mdash;purty
      soon a man. He was fighting like fury, but he didn't last long. Then they
      set fire to the house an' threw the man's body up on the roof. I couldn't
      seem to move till the flames shot up, but then I must 'a' went sort of
      loco, because I emptied my gun at 'em, which was plumb foolish at that
      distance, for me. The next thing I knowed was that half of 'em was coming
      my way as hard as they could ride, an' I lit out instanter; an' here I am.
      I can't get that sight outen my head nohow&mdash;it'll drive me loco!&rdquo; he
      screamed, sobbing like a child from the horror of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      His auditors still moved around the room, growing more and more vindictive
      all the while and more zealously endeavoring to create a still greater
      deficit in one Apache war-party. They knew what he had looked upon, for
      they themselves had become familiar with the work of Apaches in Arizona.
      They could picture it vividly in all its devilish horror. Neither of them
      paid any apparent attention to their companion, for they could not spare
      the time, and, also, they believed it best to let him fight out his own
      battles unassisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden sobbed and muttered as the minutes dragged along, at times acting
      so strangely as to draw a covert side-glance from one or both of the
      Bar-20 punchers. Then Mr. Connors saw his boon companion suddenly lean out
      of a window and immediately become the target for the hard-working enemy.
      He swore angrily at the criminal recklessness of it. &ldquo;Hey, you! Come in
      out of that! Ain't you got no brains at all, you blasted idiot! Don't you
      know that we need every gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's right. I sort of forgot,&rdquo; grinned the reckless one, obeying
      with alacrity and looking sheepish. &ldquo;But you know there's two thundering
      big tarantulas out there fighting like blazes. You ought to see 'em jump!
      It's a sort of a leap-frog fight, Red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; snorted Mr. Connors belligerently. &ldquo;<i>You'd</i> 'a' jumped if one
      of them slugs had 'a' got you! Yo're the damnedest fool that ever walked
      on two laigs, you blasted sage-hen!&rdquo; Mr. Connors was beginning to lose his
      temper and talk in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they didn't get me, did they? What you yelling about, anyhow?&rdquo;
       growled Hopalong, trying to brazen it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' <i>you</i> talking about suicide to me!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Connors,
      determined to rub it in and have the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden stared, open-mouthed, at the man who could enjoy a miserable
      spider fight under such distressing circumstances, and his shaken nerves
      became steadier as he gave thought to the fact that he was a companion of
      the two men about whose exploits he had heard so much. Evidently the
      stories had not been exaggerated. What must they think of him for giving
      way as he had? He rose to his feet in time to see a horse blunder into the
      open on Red's side of the house, and after it blundered its owner, who
      immediately lost all need of earthly conveyances. Holden laughed from the
      joy of being with a man who could shoot like that, and he took up his
      rifle and turned to a crack in the wall, filled with the determination to
      let his companions know that he was built of the right kind of timber
      after all, wounded as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red's only comment, as he pumped a fresh cartridge into the barrel, was,
      &ldquo;He must 'a' thought he saw a spider fight, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Red,&rdquo; called Hopalong. &ldquo;The big one is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What big one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you remember? That big tarantula I was watching. One was
      bigger than the other, but the little feller shore waded into him an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; shouted Red, who had to grin, despite his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, presently,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the day passed, and when darkness came upon them all of the defenders
      were wounded, Holden desperately so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, one of us has got to try to make the ranch,&rdquo; Hopalong suddenly
      announced, and his friend knew he was right. Since Holden had appeared
      upon the scene they had known that they could not try a dash; one of them
      had to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll toss for it; heads, I go,&rdquo; Red suggested, flipping a coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tails!&rdquo; cried Hopalong. &ldquo;It's only thirty miles to Buckskin, an' if I can
      get away from here I'm good to make it by eleven to-night. I'll stop at
      Cowan's an' have him send word to Lucas an' Bartlett, so there'll be
      enough in case any of our boys are out on the range in some line house. We
      can pick 'em up on the way back, so there won't be no time lost. If I get
      through you can expect excitement on the outside of this sieve by
      daylight. You an' Holden can hold her till then, because they never attack
      at night. It's the only way out of this for us&mdash;we ain't got
      cartridges or water enough to last another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red, knowing that Hopalong was taking a desperate chance in working
      through the cordon of Indians which surrounded them, and that the house
      was safe when compared to running such a gantlet, offered to go through
      the danger line with him. For several minutes a wordy war raged and
      finally Red accepted a compromise; he was to help, but not to work through
      the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's the use of all this argument?&rdquo; feebly demanded Holden. &ldquo;Why
      don't you both go? I ain't a-going to live nohow, so there ain't no use of
      anybody staying here with me, to die with me. Put a bullet through me so
      them devils can't play with me like they do with others, an' then get away
      while you've got a chance. Two men can get through as easy as one.&rdquo; He
      sank back, exhausted by the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that!&rdquo; cried Red, trying to be stern. &ldquo;I'm going to stay with
      you an' see things through. I'd be a fine sort of a coyote to sneak off
      an' leave you for them fiends. An', besides, I can't get away; my cayuse
      is hit too hard an' yourn is dead,&rdquo; he lied cheerfully. &ldquo;An' yo're going
      to get well, all right. I've seen fellers hit harder than you are pull
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong walked over to the prostrate man and shook hands with him. &ldquo;I'm
      awful glad I met you, Holden. Yo're pure grit all the way through, an' I
      like to tie to that kind of a man. Don't you worry about nothing; Red can
      handle this proposition, an' we'll have you in Buckskin by to-morrow
      night; you'll be riding again in two weeks. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Red and shook hands silently, led his horse out of the
      building and mounted, glad that the moon had not yet come up, for in the
      darkness he had a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, Hoppy!&rdquo; cried Red, running to the door. &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet&mdash;an' lots of it, too,&rdquo; groaned Holden, but he was gone. Then
      Red wheeled. &ldquo;Holden, keep yore eyes an' ears open. I'm going out to see
      that he gets off. He may run into a&mdash;&rdquo; and he, too, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden watched the doors and windows, striving to resist the weak, giddy
      feeling in his head, and ten minutes later he heard a shot and then
      several more in quick succession. Shortly afterward Red called out, and
      almost immediately the Bar-20 puncher crawled in through a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; anxiously cried the man on the floor. &ldquo;Did he make it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon so. He got away from the first crowd, anyhow. I wasn't very far
      behind him, an' by the time they woke up to what was going on he was
      through an' riding like blazes. I heard him call 'em half-breeds a moment
      later an' it sounded far off. They hit me,&mdash;fired at my flash, like I
      drilled one of them. But it ain't much, anyhow. How are you feeling now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; lied the other. &ldquo;That Cassidy is shore a wonder&mdash;he's all
      right, an' so are you. I'll never see him again, but I shore hope he gets
      through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be foolish. Here, you finish the water in yore canteen&mdash;I
      picked it up outside by yore cayuse. Then go to sleep,&rdquo; ordered Red. &ldquo;I'll
      do all the watching that's necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you'll call me when you get sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, shore I will. But don't you want the rest of the water? I ain't a
      bit thirsty&mdash;I had all I could hold just before you came,&rdquo; Red
      remarked as his companion pushed the canteen against him in the dark. He
      was choking with thirst. &ldquo;Well, then; all right,&rdquo; and Red pretended to
      drink. &ldquo;Now, then, you go to sleep; a good snooze will do you a world of
      good&mdash;it's just what you need.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BUCK TAKES A HAND
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cowan's saloon, club, and place of general assembly for the town of
      Buckskin and the nearby ranches, held a merry crowd, for it was pay-day on
      the range and laughter and liquor ran a close race. Buck Peters, his hands
      full of cigars, passed through the happy-go-lucky, do-as-you-please crowd
      and invited everybody to smoke, which nobody refused to do. Wood Wright,
      of the C-80, tuned his fiddle anew and swung into a rousing quick-step.
      Partners were chosen, the &ldquo;women&rdquo; wearing handkerchiefs on their arms to
      indicate the fact, and the room shook and quivered as the scraping of
      heavy boots filled the air with a cloud of dust. &ldquo;Allaman left!&rdquo; cried the
      prompter, and then the dance stopped as if by magic. The door had crashed
      open and a blood-stained man staggered in and towards the bar, crying,
      &ldquo;Buck! Red's hemmed in by 'Paches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; roared the foreman of the Bar-20, leaping forward, the cigars
      falling to the floor to be crushed and ground into powder by careless
      feet. He grasped his puncher and steadied him while Cowan slid an extra
      generous glassful of brandy across the bar for the wounded man. The room
      was in an uproar, men grabbing rifles and running out to get their horses,
      for it was plain to be seen that there was hard work to be done, and
      quickly. Questions, threats, curses filled the air, those who remained
      inside to get the story listening intently to the jerky narrative; those
      outside, caring less for the facts of an action past than for the action
      to come, shouted impatiently for a start to be made, even threatening to
      go on and tackle the proposition by themselves if there were not more
      haste. Hopalong told in a graphic, terse manner all that was necessary,
      while Buck and Cowan hurriedly bandaged his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; shouted the mounted crowd outside, angry, and
      impatient for a start, the prancing of horses and the clinking of metal
      adding to the noise. &ldquo;Get a move on! <i>Will</i> you hurry up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Hoppy!&rdquo; pleaded Buck, in a furore. &ldquo;Shut up, you outside!&rdquo; he
      yelled. &ldquo;You say they know that you got away, Hoppy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;All right&mdash;<i>Lanky!</i>&rdquo;
       he shouted. &ldquo;<i>Lanky!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Buck!&rdquo; and Lanky Smith roughly pushed his way through the
      crowd to his foreman's side. &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Skinny and Pete with you, an' a lead horse apiece. Strike straight
      for Powers' old ranch house. Them Injuns'll have pickets out looking for
      Hoppy's friends. You three get the pickets nearest the old trail through
      that arroyo to the southeast, an' then wait for us. We'll come along the
      high bank on the left. Don't make no noise doing it, neither, if you can
      help it. Understand? Good! Now ride like the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lanky grabbed Pete and Skinny on his way out and disappeared into the
      corral; and very soon thereafter hoof-beats thudded softly in the sandy
      street and pounded into the darkness of the north, soon lost to the ear.
      An uproar of advice and good wishes crashed after them, for the game had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Powers' old shack, boys!&rdquo; shouted a man in the door to the restless
      force outside, which immediately became more restless. &ldquo;Hey! Don't go
      yet!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Wait for me an' the rest. Don't be a lot of idiots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Excited and impatient voices replied from the darkness, vexed, grouchy,
      and querulous. &ldquo;Then get a move on&mdash;<i>whoa!</i>&mdash;it'll be light
      before we get there if you don't hustle!&rdquo; roared one voice above the
      confusion. &ldquo;You know what <i>that</i> means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! Come on! For God's sake, are you tied to the bar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're a lot of old grandmothers! Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong appeared in the door. &ldquo;I'll show you the way, boys!&rdquo; he shouted.
      &ldquo;Cowan, put my saddle on yore cayuse&mdash;<i>pronto</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, Hoppy!&rdquo; came from the street. &ldquo;We'll wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here; yo're hurt too much!&rdquo; cried Buck to his puncher, as he
      grabbed up a box of cartridges from a shelf behind the bar. &ldquo;Ain't you got
      no sense? There's enough of us to take care of this without you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong wheeled and looked his foreman squarely in the eyes. &ldquo;Red's out
      there, waiting for me&mdash;I'm going! I'd be a fine sort of a coyote to
      leave him in that hell hole an' not go back, wouldn't I!&rdquo; he said, with
      quiet determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, Cassidy!&rdquo; cried a man who hastened out to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, come on,&rdquo; replied Buck. &ldquo;There's blamed few like you,&rdquo; he
      muttered, following Hopalong outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the cayuse, Cassidy,&rdquo; cried Cowan, turning the animal over to him.
      &ldquo;<i>Wait</i>, Buck!&rdquo; and he leaped into the building and ran out again,
      shoving a bottle of brandy and a package of food into the impatient
      foreman's hand. &ldquo;Mebby Red or Hoppy'll need it&mdash;so long, an' good
      luck!&rdquo; and he was alone in a choking cloud of dust, peering through the
      darkness along the river trail after a black mass that was swallowed up
      almost instantly. Then, as he watched, the moon pushed its rim up over the
      hills and he laughed joyously as he realized what its light would mean to
      the crowd. &ldquo;There'll be great doings when <i>that</i> gang cuts loose,&rdquo; he
      muttered with savage elation. &ldquo;Wish I was with 'em. Damn Injuns, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far ahead of the main fighting force rode the three special-duty men,
      reeling off the miles at top speed and constantly distancing their
      friends, for they changed mounts at need, thanks to the lead horses
      provided by Mr. Peters' cool-headed foresight. It was a race against dawn,
      and every effort was made to win&mdash;the life of Red Connors hung in the
      balance and a minute might turn the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Powers' old ranch house the night dragged along slowly to the grim
      watcher, and the man huddled in the corner stirred uneasily and babbled,
      ofttimes crying out in horror at the vivid dreams of his disordered mind.
      Pacing ceaselessly from window to window, crack to crack, when the moon
      came up, Mr. Connors scanned the bare, level plain with anxious eyes,
      searching out the few covers and looking for dark spots on the dull gray
      sand. They never attacked at night, but still&mdash;. Through the void
      came the quavering call of a coyote, and he listened for the reply, which
      soon came from the black chaparral across the clearing. He knew where two
      of them were hiding, anyhow. Holden was muttering and tried to answer the
      calls, and Red looked at him for the hundredth time that night. He glanced
      out of the window again and noticed that there was a glow in the eastern
      sky, and shortly afterwards dawn swiftly developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouring the last few drops of the precious water between the wounded man's
      parched and swollen lips, he tossed the empty canteen from him and stood
      erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pore devil,&rdquo; he muttered, shaking his head sorrowfully, as he realized
      that Holden's delirium was getting worse all the time. &ldquo;If you was all
      right we could give them wolves hell to dance to. Well, you won't know
      nothing about it if we go under, an' that's some consolation.&rdquo; He examined
      his rifle and saw that the Colt at his thigh was fully loaded and in good
      working order. &ldquo;An' they'll pay us for their victory, by God! They'll pay
      for it!&rdquo; He stepped closer to the window, throwing the rifle into the
      hollow of his arm. &ldquo;It's about time for the rush; about time for the game&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was movement by that small chaparral to the south! To the east
      something stirred into bounding life and action; a coyote called twice&mdash;and
      then they came, on foot and silently as fleeting shadows, leaning forward
      to bring into play every ounce of energy in the slim, red legs. Smoke
      filled the room with its acrid sting. The crashing of the Winchester,
      worked with wonderful speed and deadly accuracy by the best rifle shot in
      the Southwest, brought the prostrate man to his feet in an instinctive
      response to the call to action, the necessity of defence. He grasped his
      Colt and stumbled blindly to a window to help the man who had stayed with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Red's side of the house one warrior threw up his arms and fell forward,
      sprawling with arms and legs extended; another pitched to one side and
      rolled over twice before he lay still; the legs of the third collapsed and
      threw him headlong, bunched up in a grotesque pile of lifeless flesh; the
      fourth leaped high into the air and turned a somersault before he struck
      the sand, badly wounded, and out of the fight. Holden, steadying himself
      against the wall, leaned in a window on the other side of the shack and
      emptied his Colt in a dazed manner&mdash;doing his very best. Then the man
      with the rifle staggered back with a muttered curse, his right arm
      useless, and dropped the weapon to draw his Colt with the other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden shrieked once and sank down, wagging his head slowly from side to
      side, blood oozing from his mouth and nostrils; and his companion, goaded
      into a frenzy of blood-lust and insane rage at the sight, threw himself
      against the door and out into the open, to die under the clear sky, to go
      like the man he was if he must die. &ldquo;Damn you! It'll cost you more yet!&rdquo;
       he screamed, wheeling to place his back against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumphant yells of the exultant savages were cut short and turned to
      howls of dismay by a fusillade which thundered from the south where a
      crowd of hard-riding, hard-shooting cow-punchers tore out of the thicket
      like an avalanche and swept over the open sand, yelling and cursing, and
      then separated to go in hot pursuit of the sprinting Apaches. Some stood
      up in their stirrups and fired down at a slant, making a short, chopping
      motion with their heavy Colts; others leaned forward, far over the necks
      of their horses, and shot with stationary guns; while yet others, with
      reins dangling free, worked the levers of blue Winchesters so rapidly that
      the flashes seemed to merge into a continuous flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! Thank God&mdash;an' Hoppy!&rdquo; groaned the man at the door of the
      shack, staggering forward to meet the two men who had lost no time in
      pursuit of the enemy, but had ridden straight to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was scared stiff you was done fer!&rdquo; cried Hopalong, leaping off his
      horse and shaking hands with his friend, whose hand-clasp was not as
      strong as usual. &ldquo;How's Holden?&rdquo; he demanded, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passed. It was a close&mdash;&rdquo; began Red, weakly, but his foreman
      interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, an' drink this!&rdquo; ordered Buck, kindly but sternly. &ldquo;We'll do the
      talking for a while; you can tell us all about it later on. Why, <i>hullo</i>!&rdquo;
       he cried as Lanky Smith and his two happy companions rode up. &ldquo;Reckon you
      must 'a' got them pickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore we did! Stalked 'em on our bellies, didn't we, Skinny?&rdquo; modestly
      replied Mr. Smith, the roping expert of the Bar-20. &ldquo;Ropes an' clubbed
      guns did the rest. Anyhow, there was only two anywhere near the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't see you,&rdquo; responded the foreman, tying the knot of a bandage on
      Mr. Connors' arm. &ldquo;An' we looked sharp, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon we was hunting for more; we sort of forgot what you said about
      waiting for you,&rdquo; Mr. Smith replied, grinning broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you've got a good memory now,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't find no more, though,&rdquo; offered Mr. Pete Wilson, with grave
      regret. &ldquo;An' we looked good, too. But we got Red, an' that's the whole
      game. Red, you old son-of-a-gun, you can lick yore weight in powder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad about Holden,&rdquo; muttered Red, sullenly.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOPALONG NURSES A GROUCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the excitement incident to the affair at Powers' shack had died down
      and the Bar-20 outfit worked over its range in the old, placid way, there
      began to be heard low mutterings, and an air of peevish discontent began
      to be manifested in various childish ways. And it was all caused by the
      fact that Hopalong Cassidy had a grouch, and a big one. It was two months
      old and growing worse daily, and the signs threatened contagion. His
      foreman, tired and sick of the snarling, fidgety, petulant atmosphere that
      Hopalong had created on the ranch, and driven to desperation, eagerly
      sought some chance to get rid of the &ldquo;sore-thumb&rdquo; temporarily and give him
      an opportunity to shed his generous mantle of the blues. And at last it
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew the cause for Hoppy's unusual state of mind, although there
      were many conjectures, and they covered the field rather thoroughly; but
      they did not strike on the cause. Even Red Connors, now well over all ill
      effects of the wounds acquired in the old ranch house, was forced to
      guess; and when Red had to do that about anything concerning Hopalong he
      was well warranted in believing the matter to be very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Nelson made no secret of his opinion and derived from it a great
      amount of satisfaction, which he admitted with a grin to his foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Hoppy told me he went broke playing poker over in Grant
      with Dave Wilkes and them two Lawrence boys, an' that shore explains it
      all. He's got pack sores from carrying his unholy licking. It was due to
      come for him, an' Dave Wilkes is just the boy to deliver it. That's the
      whole trouble, an' I know it, an' I'm damned glad they trimmed him. But he
      ain't got no right of making <i>us</i> miserable because he lost a few
      measly dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're wrong, son; dead, dead wrong,&rdquo; Buck replied. &ldquo;He takes his beatings
      with a grin, an' money never did bother him. No poker game that ever was
      played could leave a welt on him like the one we all mourn, an' cuss. He's
      been doing something that he don't want us to know&mdash;made a fool of
      hisself some way, most likely, an' feels so ashamed that he's sore. I've
      knowed him too long an' well to believe that gambling had anything to do
      with it. But this little trip he's taking will fix him up all right, an' I
      couldn't 'a' picked a better man&mdash;or one that I'd rather get rid of
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, lemme tell you it's blamed lucky for him that you picked him to
      go,&rdquo; rejoined Johnny, who thought more of the woeful absentee than he did
      of his own skin. &ldquo;I was going to lick him, shore, if it went on much
      longer. Me an' Red an' Billy was going to beat him up good till he forgot
      his dead injuries an' took more interest in his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck laughed heartily. &ldquo;Well, the three of you might 'a' done it if you
      worked hard an' didn't get careless, but I have my doubts. Now look here&mdash;you've
      been hanging around the bunk house too blamed much lately. Henceforth an'
      hereafter you've got to earn your grub. Get out on that west line an'
      hustle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I've had a toothache!&rdquo; snorted Johnny with a show of
      indignation, his face as sober as that of a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you'll have a stomach ache from lack of grub if you don't earn yore
      right to eat purty soon,&rdquo; retorted Buck. &ldquo;You ain't had a toothache in
      yore whole life, an' you don't know what one is. G'wan, now, or I'll give
      you a backache that'll ache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Devil of a way to treat a sick man!&rdquo; Johnny retorted, but he
      departed exultantly, whistling with much noise and no music. But he was
      sorry for one thing: he sincerely regretted that he had not been present
      when Hopalong met his Waterloo. It would have been pleasing to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the outfit blessed the proposed lease of range that took him out of
      their small circle for a time, Hopalong rode farther and farther into the
      northwest, frequently lost in abstraction which, judging by its effect
      upon him, must have been caused by something serious. He had not heard
      from Dave Wilkes about that individual's good horse which had been loaned
      to Ben Ferris, of Winchester. Did Dave think he had been killed or was
      still pursuing the man whose neck-kerchief had aroused such animosity in
      Hopalong's heart? Or had the horse actually been returned? The animal was
      a good one, a successful contender in all distances from one to five
      miles, and had earned its owner and backers much money&mdash;and Hopalong
      had parted with it as easily as he would have borrowed five dollars from
      Red. The story, as he had often reflected since, was as old as lying&mdash;a
      broken-legged horse, a wife dying forty miles away, and a horse all
      saddled which needed only to be mounted and ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts kept him company for a day and when he dismounted before
      Stevenson's &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; in Hoyt's Corners he summed up his feelings for the
      enlightenment of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it, bronc! I'd give ten dollars right now to know if I was a jackass
      or not,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;But he was an awful slick talker if he lied. An'
      I've got to go up an' face Dave Wilkes to find out about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy was not known by sight to the citizens of Hoyt's Corners,
      however well versed they might be in his numerous exploits of wisdom and
      folly. Therefore the habitues of Stevenson's Hotel did not recognize him
      in the gloomy and morose individual who dropped his saddle on the floor
      with a crash and stamped over to the three-legged table at dusk and
      surlily demanded shelter for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme a bed an' something to eat,&rdquo; he demanded, eyeing the three men
      seated with their chairs tilted against the wall. &ldquo;Do I get 'em?&rdquo; he
      asked, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; replied a one-eyed man, lazily arising and approaching him. &ldquo;One
      dollar, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' take the rocks outen that bed&mdash;I want to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dollar per for every rock you find,&rdquo; grinned Stevenson, pleasantly.
      &ldquo;There ain't no rocks in <i>my</i> beds,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks likes to be rocked to sleep,&rdquo; facetiously remarked one of the
      pair by the wall, laughing contentedly at his own pun. He bore all the
      ear-marks of being regarded as the wit of the locality&mdash;every hamlet
      has one; I have seen some myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hee, hee, hee! Yo're a droll feller, Charley,&rdquo; chuckled Old John Ferris,
      rubbing his ear with unconcealed delight. &ldquo;That's a good un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One drink, now,&rdquo; growled Hopalong, mimicking the proprietor, and glaring
      savagely at the &ldquo;droll feller&rdquo; and his companion. &ldquo;An' mind that it's a
      good one,&rdquo; he admonished the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better,&rdquo; smiled Stevenson, whereat Old John crossed his legs and
      chuckled again. Stevenson winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riding long?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going fur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till I stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you belong?&rdquo; Stevenson's pique was urging him against the ethics
      of the range, which forbade personal questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong looked at him with a light in his eye that told the host he had
      gone too far. &ldquo;Under my sombrero!&rdquo; he snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hee, hee, hee!&rdquo; chortled Old John, rubbing his ear again and nudging
      Charley. &ldquo;He ain't no fool, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know, John; he won't tell,&rdquo; replied Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong wheeled and glared at him, and Charley, smiling uneasily, made an
      appeal: &ldquo;Ain't mad, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; and Hopalong turned to the bar again, took up his liquor and
      tossed it off. Considering a moment he shoved the glass back again, while
      Old John tongued his lips in anticipation of a treat. &ldquo;It is good&mdash;fill
      it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third was even better and by the time the fourth and fifth had joined
      their predecessors Hopalong began to feel a little more cheerful. But even
      the liquor and an exceptionally well-cooked supper could not separate him
      from his persistent and set grouch. And of liquor he had already taken
      more than his limit. He had always boasted, with truth, that he had never
      been drunk, although there had been two occasions when he was not far from
      it. That was one doubtful luxury which he could not afford for the reason
      that there were men who would have been glad to see him, if only for a few
      seconds, when liquor had dulled his brain and slowed his speed of hand. He
      could never tell when and where he might meet one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped into a chair by a card table and, baffling all attempts to
      engage him in conversation, reviewed his troubles in a mumbled soliloquy,
      the liquor gradually making him careless. But of all the jumbled words his
      companions' diligent ears heard they recognized and retained only the bare
      term &ldquo;Winchester&rdquo;; and their conjectures were limited only by their
      imaginations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong stirred and looked up, shaking off the hand which had aroused
      him. &ldquo;Better go to bed, stranger,&rdquo; the proprietor was saying. &ldquo;You an' me
      are the last two up. It's after twelve, an' you look tired and sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said his wife was sick,&rdquo; muttered the puncher. &ldquo;Oh, what you saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find a bed better'n this table, stranger&mdash;it's after twelve
      an' I want to close up an' get some sleep. I'm tired myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that all? Shore I'll go to bed&mdash;like to see anybody stop me!
      Ain't no rocks in it, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary a rock,&rdquo; laughingly reassured the host, picking up Hopalong's saddle
      and leading the way to a small room off the &ldquo;office,&rdquo; his guest stumbling
      after him and growling about the rocks that lived in Winchester. When
      Stevenson had dropped the saddle by the window and departed, Hopalong sat
      on the edge of the bed to close his eyes for just a moment before tackling
      the labor of removing his clothes. A crash and a jar awakened him and he
      found himself on the floor with his back to the bed. He was hot and his
      head ached, and his back was skinned a little&mdash;and how hot and stuffy
      and choking the room had become! He thought he had blown out the light,
      but it still burned, and three-quarters of the chimney was thickly covered
      with soot. He was stifling and could not endure it any longer. After three
      attempts he put out the light, stumbled against his saddle and, opening
      the window, leaned out to breathe the pure air. As his lungs filled he
      chuckled wisely and, picking up the saddle, managed to get it and himself
      through the window and on the ground without serious mishap. He would ride
      for an hour, give the room time to freshen and cool off, and come back
      feeling much better. Not a star could be seen as he groped his way
      unsteadily towards the rear of the building, where he vaguely remembered
      having seen the corral as he rode up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Said he lived in Winchester an' his name was Bill&mdash;no, Ben
      Ferris,&rdquo; he muttered, stumbling towards a noise he knew was made by a
      horse rubbing against the corral fence. Then his feet got tangled up in
      the cinch of his saddle, which he had kicked before him, and after great
      labor he arose, muttering savagely, and continued on his wobbly way. &ldquo;Goo'
      Lord, it's darker'n cats in&mdash;<i>oof</i>!&rdquo; he grunted, recoiling from
      forcible contact with the fence he sought. Growling words unholy he felt
      his way along it and finally his arm slipped through an opening and he
      bumped his head solidly against the top bar of the gate. As he righted
      himself his hand struck the nose of a horse and closed mechanically over
      it. Cow-ponies look alike in the dark and he grinned jubilantly as he
      complimented himself upon finding his own so unerringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything is easy, when you know how. Can't fool me, ol' cayuse,&rdquo; he
      beamed, fumbling at the bars with his free hand and getting them down with
      a fool's luck. &ldquo;You can't do it&mdash;I got you firs', las', an' always;
      an' I got you good. Yessir, I got you good. Quit that rearing, you ol'
      fool! Stan' still, can't you?&rdquo; The pony sidled as the saddle hit its back
      and evoked profane abuse from the indignant puncher as he risked his
      balance in picking it up to try again, this time successfully. He began to
      fasten the girth, and then paused in wonder and thought deeply, for the
      pin in the buckle would slide to no hole but the first. &ldquo;Huh! Getting fat,
      ain't you, piebald?&rdquo; he demanded with withering sarcasm. &ldquo;You blow
      yoreself up any more'n I'll bust you wide open!&rdquo; heaving up with all his
      might on the free end of the strap, one knee pushing against the animal's
      side. The &ldquo;fat&rdquo; disappeared and Hopalong laughed. &ldquo;Been learnin' new
      tricks, ain't you? Got smart since you been travellin', hey?&rdquo; He fumbled
      with the bars again and got two of them back in place and then, throwing
      himself across the saddle as the horse started forward as hard as it could
      go, slipped off, but managed to save himself by hopping along the ground.
      As soon as he had secured the grip he wished he mounted with the ease of
      habit and felt for the reins. &ldquo;G'wan now, an' easy&mdash;it's plumb dark
      an' my head's bustin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he saddled his mount at the corral he was not aware that two of the
      three remaining horses had taken advantage of their opportunity and had
      walked out and made off in the darkness before he replaced the bars, and
      he was too drunk to care if he had known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night air felt so good that it moved him to song, but it was not long
      before the words faltered more and more and soon ceased altogether and a
      subdued snore rasped from him. He awakened from time to time, but only for
      a moment, for he was tired and sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mount very quickly learned that something was wrong and that it was
      being given its head. As long as it could go where it pleased it could do
      nothing better than head for home, and it quickened its pace towards
      Winchester. Some time after daylight it pricked up its ears and broke into
      a canter, which soon developed signs of irritation in its rider. Finally
      Hopalong opened his heavy eyes and looked around for his bearings. Not
      knowing where he was and too tired and miserable to give much thought to a
      matter of such slight importance, he glanced around for a place to finish
      his sleep. A tree some distance ahead of him looked inviting and towards
      it he rode. Habit made him picket the horse before he lay down and as he
      fell asleep he had vague recollections of handling a strange picket rope
      some time recently. The horse slowly turned and stared at the already
      snoring figure, glanced over the landscape, back the to queerest man it
      had ever met, and then fell to grazing in quiet content. A slinking coyote
      topped a rise a short distance away and stopped instantly, regarding the
      sleeping man with grave curiosity and strong suspicion. Deciding that
      there was nothing good to eat in that vicinity and that the man was
      carrying out a fell plot for the death of coyotes, it backed away out of
      sight and loped on to other hunting grounds.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A FRIEND IN NEED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Stevenson, having started the fire for breakfast, took a pail and departed
      towards the spring; but he got no farther than the corral gate, where he
      dropped the pail and stared. There was only one horse in the enclosure
      where the night before there had been four. He wasted no time in surmises,
      but wheeled and dashed back towards the hotel, and his vigorous shouts
      brought Old John to the door, sleepy and peevish. Old John's mouth dropped
      open as he beheld his habitually indolent host marking off long distances
      on the sand with each falling foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's got inter you?&rdquo; demanded Old John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our broncs are gone! Our broncs are gone!&rdquo; yelled Stevenson, shoving Old
      John roughly to one side as he dashed through the doorway and on into the
      room he had assigned to the sullen and bibulous stranger. &ldquo;I knowed it! I
      knowed it!&rdquo; he wailed, popping out again as if on springs. &ldquo;He's gone, an'
      he's took our broncs with him, the measly, low-down dog! I knowed he
      wasn't no good! I could see it in his eye; an' he wasn't drunk, not by a
      darn sight. Go out an' see for yoreself if they ain't gone!&rdquo; he snapped in
      reply to Old John's look. &ldquo;Go on out, while I throw some cold grub on the
      table&mdash;won't have no time this morning to do no cooking. He's got
      five hours' start on us, an' it'll take some right smart riding to get him
      before dark; but we'll do it, an' hang him, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this here rumpus?&rdquo; demanded a sleepy voice from upstairs.
      &ldquo;Who's hanged?&rdquo; and Charley entered the room, very much interested. His
      interest increased remarkably when the calamity was made known and he lost
      no time in joining Old John in the corral to verify the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old John waved his hands over the scene and carefully explained what he
      had read in the tracks, to his companion's great irritation, for Charley's
      keen eyes and good training had already told him all there was to learn;
      and his reading did not exactly agree with that of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley, he's gone and took our cayuses; an' that's the very way he came&mdash;'round
      the corner of the hotel. He got all tangled up an' fell over there, an'
      here he bumped inter the palisade, an' dropped his saddle. When he opened
      the bars he took my roan gelding because it was the best an' fastest, an'
      then he let out the others to mix us up on the tracks. See how he went?
      Had to hop four times on one foot afore he could get inter the saddle. An'
      that proves he was sober, for no drunk could hop four times like that
      without falling down an' being drug to death. An' he left his own critter
      behind because he knowed it wasn't no good. It's all as plain as the nose
      on your face, Charley,&rdquo; and Old John proudly rubbed his ear. &ldquo;Hee, hee,
      hee! You can't fool Old John, even if he is getting old. No, sir, b' gum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley had just returned from inside the corral, where he had looked at
      the brand on the far side of the one horse left, and he waited impatiently
      for his companion to cease talking. He took quick advantage of the first
      pause Old John made and spoke crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what corner he came 'round, or what he bumped inter; an' any
      fool can see that. An' if he left that cayuse behind because he thought it
      wasn't no good, he <i>was</i> drunk. That's a Bar-20 cayuse, an' no
      hoss-thief ever worked for that ranch. He left it behind because he stole
      it; that's why. An' he didn't let them others out because he wanted to mix
      us up, neither. How'd he know if we couldn't tell the tracks of our own
      animals? He did that to make us lose time; that's what he did it for. An'
      he couldn't tell what bronc he took last night&mdash;it was too dark. He
      must 'a' struck a match an' seen where that Bar-20 cayuse was an' then
      took the first one nearest that wasn't it. An' now you tell me how the
      devil he knowed yourn was the fastest, which it ain't,&rdquo; he finished,
      sarcastically, gloating over a chance to rub it into the man he had always
      regarded as a windy old nuisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mebby what you said is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby nothing!&rdquo; snapped Charley. &ldquo;If he wanted to mix the tracks would he
      'a' hopped like that so we couldn't help telling what cayuse he rode? He
      knowed we'd pick his trail quick, an' he knowed that every minute counted;
      that's why he hopped&mdash;why, yore roan was going like the wind afore he
      got in the saddle. If you don't believe it, look at them toe-prints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm; reckon yo're right, Charley. My eyes ain't nigh as good as they once
      was. But I heard him say something 'bout Winchester,&rdquo; replied Old John,
      glad to change the subject. &ldquo;Bet he's going over there, too. He won't get
      through that town on no critter wearing my brand. Everybody knows that
      roan, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit guessing!&rdquo; snapped Charley, beginning to lose some of the tattered
      remnant of his respect for old age. &ldquo;He's a whole lot likely to head for a
      town on a stolen cayuse, now ain't he! But we don't care where he's
      heading; we'll foller the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grub pile!&rdquo; shouted Stevenson, and the two made haste to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley, gimme a chaw of yore tobacker,&rdquo; and Old John, biting off a
      generous chunk, quietly slipped it into his pocket, there to lay until
      after he had eaten his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      All talk was tabled while the three men gulped down a cold and uninviting
      meal. Ten minutes later they had finished and separated to find horses and
      spread the news; in fifteen more they had them and were riding along the
      plain trail at top speed, with three other men close at their heels. Three
      hundred yards from the corral they pounded out of an arroyo, and Charley,
      who was leading, stood up in his stirrups and looked keenly ahead. Another
      trail joined the one they were following and ran with and on top of it.
      This, he reasoned, had been made by one of the strays and would turn away
      soon. He kept his eyes looking well ahead and soon saw that he was right
      in his surmise, and without checking the speed of his horse in the
      slightest degree he went ahead on the trail of the smaller hoof-prints. In
      a moment Old John spurred forward and gained his side and began to argue
      hot-headedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Charley!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why are you follering this track?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it's his; that's why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here, wait a minute!&rdquo; and Old John was getting red from excitement.
      &ldquo;How do you know it is? Mebby he took the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He started out on the cayuse that made these little tracks,&rdquo; retorted
      Charley, &ldquo;an' I don't see no reason to think he swapped animules. Don't
      you know the prints of yore own cayuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd, no!&rdquo; answered Old John. &ldquo;Why, I don't hardly ride the same cayuse
      the second day, straight hand-running. I tell you we ought to foller that
      other trail. He's just cute enough to play some trick on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you better do that for us,&rdquo; Charley replied, hoping against hope
      that the old man would chase off on the other and give his companions a
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't got sand enough to tackle a thing like that single-handed,&rdquo;
       laughed Jed White, winking to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old John wheeled. &ldquo;Ain't, hey! I am going to do that same thing an' prove
      that you are a pack of fools. I'm too old to be fooled by a common trick
      like that. An' I don't need no help&mdash;I'll ketch him all by myself,
      an' hang him, too!&rdquo; And he wheeled to follow the other trail, angry and
      outraged. &ldquo;Young fools,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Why, I was fighting all around
      these parts afore any of 'em knowed the difference between day an' night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard-headed old fool,&rdquo; remarked Charley, frowning, as he led the way
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gittin' old an' childish,&rdquo; excused Stevenson. &ldquo;They say warn't
      nobody in these parts could hold a candle to him in his prime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong muttered and stirred and opened his eyes to gaze blankly into
      those of one of the men who were tugging at his hands, and as he stared he
      started his stupefied brain sluggishly to work in an endeavor to explain
      the unusual experience. There were five men around him and the two who
      hauled at his hands stepped back and kicked him. A look of pained
      indignation slowly spread over his countenance as he realized beyond doubt
      that they were really kicking him, and with sturdy vigor. He considered a
      moment and then decided that such treatment was most unwarranted and
      outrageous and, furthermore, that he must defend himself and chastise the
      perpetrators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he snorted, &ldquo;what do you reckon yo're doing, anyhow? If you want to
      do any kicking, why kick each other, an' I'll help you! But I'll lick the
      whole bunch of you if you don't quite mauling me. Ain't you got no
      manners? Don't you know anything? Come 'round waking a feller up an'
      man-handling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; snapped Stevenson, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ain't I seen you before? Somewhere? Sometime?&rdquo; queried Hopalong, his
      brow wrinkling from intense concentration of thought. &ldquo;I ain't dreaming;
      I've seen a one-eyed coyote som'ers, lately, ain't I?&rdquo; he appealed,
      anxiously, to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; ordered Charley, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I've seen you, too. Funny, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've seen me, all right,&rdquo; retorted Stevenson. &ldquo;Get up, damn you! Get
      up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can't&mdash;my han's are tied!&rdquo; exclaimed Hopalong in great
      wonder, pausing in his exertions to cogitate deeply upon this most
      remarkable phenomenon. &ldquo;Tied up! Now what the devil do you think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use yore feet, you thief!&rdquo; rejoined Stevenson roughly, stepping forward
      and delivering another kick. &ldquo;Use yore feet!&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief! Me a thief! Shore I'll use my feet, you yaller dog!&rdquo; yelled the
      prostrate man, and his boot heel sank into the stomach of the offending
      Mr. Stevenson with sickening force and laudable precision. He drew it back
      slowly, as if debating shoving it farther. &ldquo;Call me a thief, hey! Come
      poking 'round kicking honest punchers an' calling 'em names! Anybody want
      the other boot?&rdquo; he inquired with grave solicitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stevenson sat down forcibly and rocked to and fro, doubled up and gasping
      for breath, and Hopalong squinted at him and grinned with happiness. &ldquo;Hear
      him sing! Reg'lar ol' brass band. Sounds like a cow pulling its hoofs
      outen the mud. Called me a thief, he did, just now. An' I won't let nobody
      kick me an' call me names. He's a liar, just a plain, squaw's dog liar, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men grabbed him and raised him up, holding him tightly, and they were
      not over careful to handle him gently, which he naturally resented.
      Charley stepped in front of him to go to the aid of Stevenson and caught
      the other boot in his groin, dropping as if he had been shot. The man on
      the prisoner's left emitted a yell and loosed his hold to sympathize with
      a bruised shinbone, and his companion promptly knocked the bound and still
      intoxicated man down. Bill Thomas swore and eyed the prostrate figure with
      resentment and regret. &ldquo;Hate to hit a man who can fight like that when
      he's loaded an' tied. I'm glad, all the same, that he ain't sober an'
      loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you ain't going to hit him no more!&rdquo; snapped Jed White, reddening
      with anger. &ldquo;I'm ready to hang him, 'cause that's what he deserves, an'
      what we're here for, but I'm damned if I'll stand for any more mauling. I
      don't blame him for fighting, an' they didn't have no right to kick him in
      the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't kick him in the beginning,&rdquo; grinned Bill. &ldquo;Kicked him in the
      ending. Anyhow,&rdquo; he continued seriously, &ldquo;I didn't hit him hard&mdash;didn't
      have to. Just let him go an' shoved him quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just naturally going to clean house,&rdquo; muttered the prisoner, sitting
      up and glaring around. &ldquo;Untie my han's an' gimme a gun or a club or
      anything, an' watch yoreselves get licked. Called me a thief! What are you
      fellers, then?&mdash;sticking me up an' busting me for a few measly
      dollars. Why didn't you take my money an' lemme sleep, 'stead of waking me
      up an' kicking me? I wouldn't 'a' cared then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, now; get up. We ain't through with you yet, not by a whole lot,&rdquo;
       growled Bill, helping him to his feet and steadying him. &ldquo;I'm plumb glad
      you kicked 'em; it was coming to 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain't; you can't fool me,&rdquo; gravely assured Hopalong. &ldquo;Yo're
      lying, an' you know it. What you going to do now? Ain't I got money
      enough? Wish I had an even break with you fellers! Wish my outfit was
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stevenson, on his feet again, walked painfully up and shook his fist at
      the captive, from the side. &ldquo;You'll find out what we want of you, you
      damned hoss-thief!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We're going to tie you to that there limb
      so yore feet'll swing above the grass, that's what we're going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill and Jed had their hands full for a moment and as they finally
      mastered the puncher, Charley came up with a rope. &ldquo;Hurry up&mdash;no use
      dragging it out this way. I want to get back to the ranch some time before
      next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>I</i> ain't no hoss-thief, you liar!&rdquo; Hopalong yelled. &ldquo;My name's
      Hopalong Cassidy of the Bar-20, an' when I tell my friends about what
      you've gone an' done they'll make you hard to find! You gimme any kind of
      a chance an' I'll do it all by myself, sick as I am, you yaller dogs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that yore cayuse?&rdquo; demanded Charley, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong squinted towards the animal indicated. &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one there, you fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; replied Hopalong, surprised. &ldquo;Well, I never seen it afore. My
      cayuse is&mdash;is&mdash;where the devil <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; he asked, looking
      around anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd you get that one, then, if it ain't yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never had it&mdash;'t ain't mine, nohow,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, with strong
      conviction. &ldquo;Mine was a <i>hoss</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stole that cayuse last night outen Stevenson's corral,&rdquo; continued
      Charley, merely as a matter of form. Charley believed that a man had the
      right to be heard before he died&mdash;it wouldn't change the result and
      so could not do any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Why&mdash;&rdquo; his forehead became furrowed again, but the events of
      the night before were vague in his memory and he only stumbled in his
      soliloquy. &ldquo;But <i>I</i> wouldn't swap my cayuse for that spavined,
      saddle-galled, ring-boned bone-yard! Why, it interferes, an' it's got the
      heaves something awful!&rdquo; he finished triumphantly, as if an appeal to
      common sense would clinch things. But he made no headway against them, for
      the rope went around his neck almost before he had finished talking and a
      flurry of excitement ensued. When the dust settled he was on his back
      again and the rope was being tossed over the limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd had been too busily occupied to notice anything away from the
      scene of their strife and were greatly surprised when they heard a hail
      and saw a stranger sliding to a stand not twenty feet from them. &ldquo;What's
      this?&rdquo; demanded the newcomer, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley's gun glinted as it swung up and the stranger swore again. &ldquo;What
      you doing?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Take that gun off'n me or I'll blow you apart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind yore business an' sit still!&rdquo; Charley snapped. &ldquo;You ain't in no
      position to blow anything apart. We've got a hoss-thief an' we're shore
      going to hang him regardless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' if there's any trouble about it we can hang two as well as we can
      one,&rdquo; suggested Stevenson, placidly. &ldquo;You sit tight an' mind yore own
      affairs, stranger,&rdquo; he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong turned his head slowly. &ldquo;He's a liar, stranger; just a plain,
      squaw's dog of a liar. An' I'll be much obliged if you'll lick hell outen
      'em an' let&mdash;<i>why, hullo, hoss-thief</i>!&rdquo; he shouted, at once
      recognizing the other. It was the man he had met in the gospel tent, the
      man he had chased for a horse-thief and then swapped mounts with. &ldquo;Stole
      any more cayuses?&rdquo; he asked, grinning, believing that everything was all
      right now. &ldquo;Did you take that cayuse back to Grant?&rdquo; he finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Han's up!&rdquo; roared Stevenson, also covering the stranger. &ldquo;So yo're
      another one of 'em, hey? We're in luck to-day. Watch him, boys, till I get
      his gun. If he moves, drop him quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned fool!&rdquo; cried Ferris, white with rage. &ldquo;He ain't no thief, an'
      neither am I! My name's Ben Ferris an' I live in Winchester. Why, that man
      you've got is Hopalong Cassidy&mdash;Cassidy, of the Bar-20!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still&mdash;you can talk later, mebby,&rdquo; replied Stevenson, warily
      approaching him. &ldquo;Watch him, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; shouted Ferris, murder in his eyes. &ldquo;Don't you try that on me!
      I'll get one of you before I go; I'll shore get one! You can listen a
      minute, an' I can't get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; talk quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferris pleaded as hard as he knew how and called attention to the
      condition of the prisoner. &ldquo;If he did take the wrong cayuse he was too
      blind drunk to know it! Can't you <i>see</i> he was!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep; through yet?&rdquo; asked Stevenson, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I ain't started yet!&rdquo; Ferris yelled. &ldquo;He did me a good turn once, one
      that I can't never repay, an' I'm going to stop this murder or go with
      him. If I go I'll take one of you with me, an' my friends an' outfit'll
      get the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till Old John gets here,&rdquo; suggested Jed to Charley. &ldquo;He ought to
      know this feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the Lord's sake!&rdquo; snorted Charley. &ldquo;He won't show up for a week. Did
      you hear that, fellers?&rdquo; he laughed, turning to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; began Stevenson, moving slowly ahead again. &ldquo;You give us yore
      guns an' sit quiet till we gets this feller out of the way. We'll wait
      till Old John Ferris comes before doing anything with you. He ought to
      know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows me all right; an' he'd like to see me hung,&rdquo; replied the
      stranger. &ldquo;I won't give up my guns, an' you won't lynch Hopalong Cassidy
      while I can pull a trigger. That's flat!&rdquo; He began to talk feverishly to
      gain time and his eyes lighted suddenly. Seeing that Jed White was
      wavering, Stevenson ordered them to go on with the work they had come to
      perform, and he watched Ferris as a cat watches a mouse, knowing that he
      would be the first man hit if the stranger got a chance to shoot. But
      Ferris stood up very slowly in his stirrups so as not to alarm the five
      with any quick movement, and shouted at the top of his voice, grabbing off
      his sombrero and waving it frantically. A faint cheer reached his ears and
      made the lynchers turn quickly and look behind them. Nine men were tearing
      towards them at a dead gallop and had already begun to forsake their
      bunched-up formation in favor of an extended line. They were due to arrive
      in a very few minutes and caused Mr. Ferris' heart to overflow with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me an' my outfit,&rdquo; he said, laughing softly and waving his hand towards
      the newcomers, &ldquo;started out this morning to round up a bunch of cows, an'
      we got jackasses instead. Now lynch him, damn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nine swept up in skirmish order, guns out and ready for anything in
      the nature of trouble that might zephyr up. &ldquo;What's the matter, Ben?&rdquo;
       asked Tom Murphy ominously. As under-foreman of the ranch he regarded
      himself as spokesman. And at that instant catching sight of the rope, he
      swore savagely under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Tom; nothing now,&rdquo; responded Mr. Ferris. &ldquo;They was going to hang
      my friend there, Mr. Hopalong Cassidy, of the Bar-20. He's the feller that
      lent me his cayuse to get home on when Molly was sick. I'm going to take
      him back to the ranch when he gets sober an' introduce him to some very
      good friends of hissn that he ain't never seen. Ain't I, Cassidy?&rdquo; he
      demanded with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Cassidy made no reply. He was sound asleep, as he had been since
      the advent of his very good and capable friend, Mr. Ben Ferris, of
      Winchester.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. TOWNSEND, MARSHAL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Cassidy went to the ranch and lived like a lord until shame drove him
      away. He had no business to live on cake and pie and wonderful dishes that
      Mrs. Ferris and her sister literally forced on him, and let Buck's mission
      wait on his convenience. So he tore himself away and made up for lost time
      as he continued his journey on his own horse, for which Tom Murphy and
      three men had faced down the scowling population of Hoyt's Corners. The
      rest of his journey was without incident until, on his return home along
      another route, he rode into Rawhide and heard about the marshal, Mr.
      Townsend.
    </p>
    <p>
      This individual was unanimously regarded as an affliction upon society and
      there had been objections to his continued existence, which had been
      overruled by the object himself. Then word had gone forth that a
      substantial reward and the undying gratitude of a considerable number of
      people awaited the man who would rid the community of the pest who seemed
      to be ubiquitous. Several had come in response to the call, one had
      returned in a wagon, and the others were now looked upon as martyrs, and
      as examples of asinine foolhardiness. Then it had been decided to elect a
      marshal, or perhaps two or three, to preserve the peace of the town; but
      this was a flat failure. In the first place, Mr. Townsend had dispersed
      the meeting with no date set for a new one; in the second, no man wanted
      the office; and as a finish to the comedy, Mr. Townsend cheerfully
      announced that hereafter and henceforth he was the marshal, self-appointed
      and self-sustained. Those who did not like it could easily move to other
      localities.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this touch of office-holding came ambition, and of stern stuff. The
      marshal asked himself why he could not be more officers than one and found
      no reason. Thereupon he announced that he was marshal, town council,
      mayor, justice, and pound-keeper. He did not go to the trouble of
      incorporating himself as the Town of Rawhide, because he knew nothing of
      such immaterial things; but he was the town, and that sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been grievously troubled about finances in the past, and he firmly
      believed that genius such as his should be above such petty annoyances as
      being &ldquo;broke.&rdquo; That was why he constituted himself the keeper of the
      public pound, which contented him for a short time, but later, feeling
      that he needed more money than the pound was giving him, he decided that
      the spirit of the times demanded public improvements, and therefore, as
      the executive head of the town, he levied taxes and improved the town by
      improving his wardrobe and the manner of his living. Each saloon must pay
      into the town treasury the sum of one hundred dollars per year, which
      entitled it to police protection and assured it that no new competitors
      would be allowed to do business in Rawhide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say he was not furiously popular, and the crowds congregated
      where he was not. His tyranny was based upon his uncanny faculty of
      anticipating the other man's draw. The citizens were not unaccustomed to
      seeing swift death result to the slower man from misplaced confidence in
      his speed of hand&mdash;that was in the game&mdash;an even break; but to
      oppose an individual who <i>always</i> knew what you were going to do
      before you knew it yourself&mdash;this was very discouraging. Therefore,
      he flourished and waxed fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late, however, he had been very low in finances and could expect no
      taxes to be paid for three months. Even the pound had yielded him nothing
      for over a week, the old patrons of Rawhide's stores and saloons
      preferring to ride twenty miles farther in another direction than to
      redeem impounded horses. Perhaps his prices had been too high, he thought;
      so he assembled the town council, the mayor, the marshal, and the keeper
      of the public pound to consult upon the matter. He decided that the prices
      were too high and at once posted a new notice announcing the cut. It was
      hard to fall from a dollar to &ldquo;two bits,&rdquo; but the treasury was low&mdash;the
      times were panicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had changed the notice he strolled up to the Paradise to
      inform the bartender that impounding fines had been cut to bargain prices
      and to ask him to make the fact generally known through his patrons. As he
      came within sight of the building he jumped with pleasure, for a horse was
      standing dejectedly before the door. Joy of joys, trade was picking up&mdash;a
      stranger had come to town! Hastening back to the corral, he added a cipher
      to the posted figure, added a decimal point, and changed the cents sign to
      that of a dollar. Two dollars and fifty cents was now the price prescribed
      by law. Returning hastily to the Paradise, he led the animal away,
      impounded it, and then sat down in front of the corral gate with his
      Winchester across his knees. Two dollars and fifty cents! Prosperity had
      indeed returned!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the CG ranch is I dunno, but I do know where one of their cayuses
      is,&rdquo; he mused, glancing between two of the corral posts at the sleepy
      animal. &ldquo;If I has to auction it off to pay for its keep and the fine, the
      saddle will bring a good, round sum. I allus knowed that a dollar wasn't
      enough, nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat Fisher, punching cows for the CG and tired of his job, leaned
      comfortably back in his chair in the Paradise and swapped lies with the
      all-wise bartender. After a while he realized that he was hopelessly
      outclassed at this diversion and he dug down into his pocket and brought
      to light some loose silver and regarded it thoughtfully. It was all the
      money he had and was beginning to grow interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, was you ever broke?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, a trace of sadness in his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bartender glanced at him quickly, but remained judiciously silent,
      smelling the preamble of an attempt to &ldquo;touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have been, am now, an' allus will be, more or less,&rdquo; continued
      Fisher, in soliloquy, not waiting for an answer to his question. &ldquo;Money
      an' me don't ride the same range, not any. Here I am fifty miles away from
      my ranch, with four dollars and ninety-five cents between me an'
      starvation an' thirst, an' me not going home for three days yet. I was
      going to quit the CG this month, but now I gotta go on working for it till
      another pay-day. I don't even own a cayuse. Now, just to show you what
      kind of a prickly pear I am, I'll cut the cards with you to see who owns
      this,&rdquo; he suggested, smiling brightly at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bartender laughed, treated on the house, and shuffled out from behind
      the bar with a pack of greasy playing cards. &ldquo;All at once, or a dollar a
      shot?&rdquo; he asked, shuffling deftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way it suits you,&rdquo; responded Fisher, nonchalantly. He knew how a
      sport should talk; and once he had cut the cards to see who should own his
      full month's pay. He hoped he would be more successful this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make no difference to me,&rdquo; rejoined the bartender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; all at once, an' have it over with. It's a kid's game, at
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High wins, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High wins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender pushed the cards across the table for his companion to cut.
      Nat did so, and turned up a deuce. &ldquo;Oh, don't bother,&rdquo; he said, sliding
      the four dollars and ninety-five cents across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; grinned the bartender, who was a stickler for rules. He reached
      over and turned up a card, and then laughed. &ldquo;Matched, by George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; grinned Fisher, his face clearing with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bartender shuffled, and Fisher turned a five, which proved to be just
      one point shy when his companion had shown his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; remarked Fisher, watching his money disappear into the bartender's
      pocket, &ldquo;I'll put up my gun agin ten of yore dollars if yo're game. How
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done&mdash;that's a good weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None better. Ah, a jack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say queen&mdash;nope, <i>king</i>!&rdquo; exulted the dispenser of liquids.
      &ldquo;Say, mebby you can get a job around here when you quit the CG,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good idea,&rdquo; replied Fisher. &ldquo;But let's finish this while we're
      at it. I got a good saddle outside on my cayuse&mdash;go look it over an'
      tell me how much you'll put up agin it. If you win it an' can't use it,
      you can sell it. It's first class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender walked to the door, looked carefully around for a moment,
      his eyes fastening upon a trail in the sandy street. Then he laughed.
      &ldquo;There ain't no saddle out here,&rdquo; he reported, well knowing where it could
      be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Has that ornery piebald&mdash;well, what do you think of that!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Fisher, looking up and down the street. &ldquo;This is the first time
      that ever happened to me. Why, some coyote stole it! Look at the tracks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it ain't stolen,&rdquo; the bartender responded. He considered a moment and
      then made a suggestion. &ldquo;Mebby the marshal can tell you where it is&mdash;he
      knows everything like that. Nobody can take a cayuse out of this town
      while the marshal is up an' well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky town, all right,&rdquo; chirped Fisher. &ldquo;An' where is the marshal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find him down the back way a couple of hundred yards; can't miss
      him. He allus hangs out there when there are cayuses in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for him! I'll chase right down an' see him; an' when I get that
      piebald&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender watched him go around the corner and shook his head sadly.
      &ldquo;Yes; hell of a lucky town,&rdquo; he snorted bitterly, listening for the riot
      to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal still sat against the corral gate and stroked the Winchester
      in beatific contemplation. He had a fine job and he was happy. Suddenly
      leaning forward to look up the road, he smiled derisively and shifted the
      gun. A cow-puncher was coming his way rapidly, and on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the marshal of this flea of a town?&rdquo; politely inquired the
      newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the same,&rdquo; replied the man with the rifle. &ldquo;Anything I kin do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; have you seen a piebald cayuse straying around loose-like, or
      anybody leading one&mdash;CG being the brand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; it was straying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' which way did it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the town pound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Pond! What'n blazes is it doing with a pond? Couldn't it drink
      without getting in? Where's the pond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right here. It's eating its fool head off. I said pound, not pond.
      P-o-u-n-d; which means that it's pawned, in hock, for destroying the
      vegetation of Rawhide, an' disturbing the public peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good joke on the piebald, all right; it was never locked up before,&rdquo;
       laughed Fisher, trying to read a sign that faced away from him at a slight
      angle. &ldquo;Get it out for me an' I'll disturb <i>its</i> peace. Sorry it put
      you to all that trouble,&rdquo; he sympathized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars an' four bits, an' a dollar initiation fee&mdash;it wasn't
      never in the pound before. That makes three an' a half. Got the money with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; yelled Fisher, emerging from his trance. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he yelled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't none deaf,&rdquo; placidly replied the marshal. &ldquo;Got the money, the
      three an' a half?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think yo're going to skin me outen three-fifty, one-fifty, or one
      measly cent, you need some medicine, an' I'll give it to you in pill form!
      You'd make a bum-looking angel, so get up an' hand over that cayuse, <i>an'
      do it damned quick</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-fifty, an' two bits extry for feed. It'll cost you 'bout a dollar a
      day for feed. At the end of the week I'll sell that cayuse at auction to
      pay its bills if you don't cough up. Got the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a lead slug for you if I can borrow my gun for five minutes!&rdquo;
       retorted Fisher, seething double from anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars more for contempt of court,&rdquo; pleasantly responded Mr.
      Townsend. &ldquo;As Justice of the Peace of this community I must allow no
      disrespect, no contempt of the sovereign law of this town to go
      unpunished. That makes it eight-seventy-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' to think I lost my gun!&rdquo; shouted Fisher, dancing with rage. &ldquo;I'll get
      that cayuse out an' I won't pay a cent, not a damned cent! An' I'll get
      you at the same time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you dust around for fifteen dollars even an' stop yore contempt of
      court an' threats or I'll drill you just for luck!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Townsend,
      angrily. &ldquo;If you keep on working yore mouth like that there won't be
      nothing coming to you when I sell that cayuse of yourn. Turn around an'
      strike out or I'll put you with yore ancestors!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE STRANGER'S PLAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fisher, wild with rage, returned to the Paradise and profanely unfolded
      the tale of his burning wrongs to the bartender and demanded the loan of
      his gun, which the bartender promptly refused. The present owner of the
      gun liked Fisher very much for being such a sport and sympathized with him
      deeply, but he did not want to have such a pleasing acquaintance killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here: you cool down an' I'll lend you fifteen dollars on that
      saddle of yourn. You go up an' get that cayuse out before the price goes
      up any higher&mdash;you don't know that man like I do,&rdquo; remarked the man
      behind the bar earnestly. &ldquo;That feller Townsend can shoot the eyes out of
      a small dog at ten miles, purty nigh. Do you savvy my drift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't pay him a cussed cent, an' when he goes to sell that piebald at
      auction, I'll be on hand with a gun; I'll get one somewhere, all right,
      even if I have to steal it. Then I'll shoot out <i>his</i> eyes at ten
      paces. Why, he's a two-laigged hold-up! That man would&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped
      as a stranger entered the room. &ldquo;Hey, stranger! Don't you leave that
      cayuse of yourn outside all alone or that coyote of a marshal will steal
      it, shore. He's the biggest thief I ever knowed. He'll lift yore animal
      quick as a wink!&rdquo; Fisher warned, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked at him in surprise and then smiled. &ldquo;Is it usual for a
      marshal to steal cayuses? Somewhat out of line, ain't it?&rdquo; he asked
      Fisher, glancing at the bartender for light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what's the rule&mdash;that marshal just stole my cayuse; an'
      he'll take yourn, too, if you ain't careful,&rdquo; Fisher replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled the stranger, smiling still more, &ldquo;I reckon I ain't going
      to stay out there an' watch it, an' I can't bring it in here. But I reckon
      it'll be all right. You see, I carry 'big medicine' agin hoss-thieves,&rdquo; he
      replied, tapping his holster and smiling as he remembered the time, not
      long past, when he himself had been accused of being one. &ldquo;I'll take a
      chance if he will&mdash;what'll you all have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little whiskey,&rdquo; replied Fisher, uneasily, worrying because he could not
      stand for a return treat. &ldquo;But, say; you keep yore eye on that animal,
      just the same,&rdquo; he added, and then hurriedly gave his reasons. &ldquo;An' the
      worst part of the whole thing is that I ain't got no gun, an' can't seem
      to borrow none, neither,&rdquo; he added, wistfully eyeing the stranger's Colt.
      &ldquo;I gambled mine away to the bartender here an' he won't lemme borrow it
      for five minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never heard tell of such a thing before!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger,
      hardly believing his ears, and aghast at the thought that such conditions
      could exist. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said, addressing the bartender, &ldquo;how is it that
      this sort of thing can go on in this town?&rdquo; When the bartender had
      explained at some length, his interested listener smote the bar with a
      heavy fist and voiced his outraged feelings. &ldquo;I'll shore be plumb happy to
      spread that coyote marshal all over his cussed pound! Say, come with me;
      I'm going down there right now an' get that cayuse, an' if the marshal
      opens his mouth to peep I'll get him, too. I'm itching for a chance to
      tunnel a man like him. Come on an' see the show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; retorted Fisher. &ldquo;While I am some pleased to meet a white man,
      an' have a deep an' abiding gratitude for yore noble offer, I can't let
      you do it. He put it over on me, an' I'm the one that's got to shoot him
      up. He's mine, my pudding; an' I'm hogging him all to myself. That is one
      luxury I can indulge in even if I am broke; an' I'm sorry, but I can't
      give you cards. Seeing, however, as you are so friendly to the cause of
      liberty an' justice, suppose you lend me yore gun for about three minutes
      by the watch. From what I've been told about this town such an act will
      win for you the eternal love an' gratitude of a down-trodden people; yore
      gun will blaze the way to liberty an' light, freedom an' the right to own
      yore own property, an' keep it. All I ask is that I be the undeserving
      medium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-men,&rdquo; sighed the bartender. &ldquo;Deacon Jones will now pass down the aisle
      an' collect the buttons an' tin money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; continued Fisher, warming up, when he saw that his words had
      not produced the desired result, &ldquo;King James the Twelfth, on the memorable
      an' blood-soaked field of Trafalgar, gave men their rights. On that great
      day he signed the Magnet Charter, and proved himself as great a liberator
      as the sainted Lincoln. You, on this most auspicious occasion, hold in
      yore strong hand the destiny of this town&mdash;the women an' children in
      this cursed community will rise up an' bless you forever an' pass yore
      name down to their ancestors as a man of deeds an' honor! Let us pause to
      consider this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold that pause!&rdquo; interrupted the astounded bartender hurriedly, and with
      shaking voice. &ldquo;String it out till I get untangled! I ain't up much on
      history, so I won't take no chance with that; but I want to tell our
      eloquent guest that there ain't no women <i>or</i> children in this town.
      An' if there was, I sort of reckon their ancestors would be born first.
      What do you think about it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us pause to consider the shameful an' burning <i>indignity</i>
      perpetrated upon us to-day!&rdquo; continued Fisher, unheeding the bartender's
      words. &ldquo;I, a peaceful, law-abiding <i>citizen</i> of this <i>glorious</i>
      Commonwealth, a free an' <i>equal</i> member of a liberty-loving nation, a
      nation whose standard is, <i>now</i> and forever, 'Gimme liberty or gimme
      det', a <i>nation</i> that stands for all the conceivable benefits that
      mankind may enjoy, a <i>nation</i> that scintillates pyrotechnically over
      the prostitution of power&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bang!</i> went the bartender's fist on the counter. &ldquo;Hey! Pause again!
      Wait a minute! Go back to 'shameful an' burning,' and gimme a chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that stands for an even break, I, Nathaniel G. Fisher, have been
      deprived of one of my inalienable rights, the right of locomotion to
      distant an' other parts. <i>An''</i> I say, right here an' now, that I
      won't allow no spavined individual with thieving prehensils to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has that pound-keeper got a rifle?&rdquo; calmly interrupted the stranger,
      without a pang of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has. Thus has it allus been with tyrants&mdash;well armed, fortified
      by habit an' tradition&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't get my gun, savvy? We'll find another way to get that
      cayuse as long as you feel that the marshal is yore hunting. Besides, this
      man's gall deserves some respect; it is genius, an' to pump genius full of
      cold lead is to act rash. Now, suppose you tell me when this auction is
      due to come off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not for a week; he wants to run up the board an' keep expenses.
      Tyrants, such as him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; interposed the bartender, &ldquo;he'll make the expenses equal what he
      gets for the cayuse, no matter what it comes to. An' he's the whole town,
      an' the justice of the peace, besides. What he says goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm the Governor of the State an' I've got the Supreme Court right
      here in my holster, so I reckon I can reverse his official acts an' fill
      his legal opinions full of holes,&rdquo; the stranger replied, laughing
      heartily. &ldquo;Bartender, will you help me play a little joke on His Honore,
      the Town,&mdash;just a little harmless joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that all depends whether the joke is harmless on <i>me</i>. You
      see, he can shoot like the devil&mdash;he allus knows when a man is going
      to draw, an' gets his gun out first. I ain't got no respect for him, but I
      take off my hat to his gunplay, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled. &ldquo;Well, I can shoot a bit myself. But I shore wish
      he'd hold that auction quick&mdash;I've got to go on home without losing
      any more time. Fisher, suppose you go down to the pound and dare that
      tumble-bug to hold the auction this afternoon. Tell him that you'll shoot
      him full of holes if he goes pulling off any auction to-day, an' dare him
      to try it. I want it to come off before night, an' I reckon that'll hustle
      it along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do anything to get the edge on that thief,&rdquo; replied Fisher, quickly,
      &ldquo;but don't you reckon I'd better tote a gun, going down an' bearding such
      a thief in his own den? You know I allus like to shoot when I'm being shot
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't blame you; it's only a petty weakness,&rdquo; grinned the
      stranger, hanging onto his Colt as if fearing that the other would snatch
      it and run. &ldquo;But you'll do better without any gun&mdash;me an' the
      bartender don't want to have to go down there an' bring you back on a
      plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; sighed Fisher, reluctantly, &ldquo;but he'll jump the price
      again. He'll fine me for contempt of court an' make me pay money I ain't
      got for disturbing him. But I'm game&mdash;so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gained the street, the stranger turned to the bartender. &ldquo;Now,
      friend, you tell me if this man of gall, this Mr. Townsend, has got many
      friends in town&mdash;anybody that'll be likely to pot shoot from the back
      when things get warm. I can't watch both ends unless I know what I'm up
      against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No!</i> Every man in town hates him,&rdquo; answered the bartender, hastily,
      and with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's good. Now, I wonder if you could see 'most everybody that's in
      town now an' get 'em to promise to help me by letting me run this all by
      myself. All I want them to do is not to say a word. It ain't hard to keep
      still when you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I reckon I might see 'em&mdash;there ain't many here this time of
      day,&rdquo; responded the bartender. &ldquo;But what's yore game, anyhow?&rdquo; he asked,
      suddenly growing suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just a little scheme I figgered out,&rdquo; the stranger replied, and then
      he confided in the bartender, who jigged a few fancy steps to show his
      appreciation of the other's genius. His suspicions left him at once, and
      he hastened out to tell the inhabitants of the town to follow his
      instructions to the letter, and he knew they would obey, and be glad,
      hilariously glad, to do so. While he was hurrying around giving his
      instructions, the CG puncher returned to the hotel and reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it worked, all right,&rdquo; Fisher growled. &ldquo;I told him what I'd do to
      him if he tried to auction that cayuse off an' he retorted that if I
      didn't shut up an' mind my own business, that he'd sell the horse this
      noon, at twelve o'clock, in the public square, wherever that is. I told
      him he was a coyote and dared him to do it. Told him I'd pump him full of
      air ducts if he didn't wait till next week. Said I had the promise of a
      gun an' that it'd give me great pleasure to use it on him if he tried any
      auctioneering at my expense this noon. Then he fined me five dollars more,
      swore that he'd show me what it meant to dare the marshal of Rawhide an'
      insult the dignity of the court an' town council, an' also that he'd shoot
      my liver all through my system if I didn't leave him to his reflections.
      Now, look here, stranger; noon is only two hours away an' I'm due to lose
      my outfit: what are <i>you</i> going to do to get me out of this mess?&rdquo; he
      finished anxiously, hands on hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did real well, very fine, indeed,&rdquo; replied the stranger, smiling with
      content. &ldquo;An' don't you worry about that outfit&mdash;I'm going to get it
      back for you an' a little bit more. So, as long as you don't lose nothing,
      you ain't got no kick coming, have you? An' you ain't got no interest in
      what I'm going to do. Just sit tight an' keep yore eyes an' ears open at
      noon. Meantime, if you want something to do to keep you busy, practise
      making speeches&mdash;you ought to be ashamed to be punching cows an'
      working for a living when you could use yore talents an' get a lot of
      graft besides. Any man who can say as much on nothing as you can ought to
      be in the Senate representing some railroad company or waterpower steal&mdash;you
      don't have to work there, just loaf an' take easy money for cheating the
      people what put you there. Now, don't get mad&mdash;I'm only stringing
      you: I wouldn't be mean enough to call you a senator. To tell the truth, I
      think yo're too honest to even think of such a thing. But go ahead an'
      practise&mdash;<i>I</i> don't mind it a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! I couldn't go to Congress,&rdquo; laughed Fisher. &ldquo;I'd have to practise by
      getting elected mayor of some town an' then go to the Legislature for the
      finishing touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Townsend would beat you out,&rdquo; murmured the stranger, looking out of
      the window and wishing for noon. He sauntered over to a chair, placed it
      where he could see his horse, and took things easy. The bartender returned
      with several men at his heels, and all were grinning and joking. They took
      up their places against the bar and indulged in frequent fits of
      chuckling, not letting their eyes stray from the man in the chair and the
      open street through the door, where the auction was to be held. They
      regarded the stranger in the light of a would-be public benefactor, a
      martyr, who was to provide the town with a little excitement before he
      followed his predecessors into the grave. Perhaps he would <i>not</i> be
      killed, perhaps he would shoot the pound-keeper and general public
      nuisance&mdash;but ah, this was the stuff of which dreams were made: the
      marshal would never be killed, he would thrive and outlive his
      fellow-townsmen, and die in bed at a ripe old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the citizens, dangling his legs from the card table, again looked
      closely at the man with the plan, and then turned to a companion beside
      him. &ldquo;I've seen that there feller som'ers, sometime,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I <i>know</i>
      I have. But I'll be teetotally dod-blasted if I can place him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jim; I never saw him afore, an' I don't know who he is,&rdquo; replied
      the other, refilling his pipe with elaborate care, &ldquo;but if he can kill
      Townsend to-day, I'll be so plumb joyous I won't know what to do with
      m'self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid he won't, though,&rdquo; remarked another, lolling back against the
      bar. &ldquo;The marshal was born to hang&mdash;nobody can beat him on the draw.
      But, anyhow, we're going to see some fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first speaker, still straining his memory for a clue to the stranger's
      identity, pulled out a handful of silver and placed it on the table. &ldquo;I'll
      bet that he makes good,&rdquo; he offered, but there were no takers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger now lazily arose and stepped into the doorway, leaning
      against the jamb and shaking his holster sharply to loosen the gun for
      action. He glanced quickly behind him and spoke curtly: &ldquo;Remember, now&mdash;<i>I</i>
      am to do all the talking at this auction; you fellers just look on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mumble of assent replied to him, and the townsmen craned their necks to
      look out. A procession slowly wended its way up the street, led by the
      marshal, astride a piebald horse bearing the crude brand of the CG. Three
      men followed him and numerous dogs of several colors, sizes, and ages
      roamed at will, in a listless, bored way, between the horse and the men.
      The dust arose sluggishly and slowly dissipated in the hot, shimmering
      air, and a fly buzzed with wearying persistence against the dirty glass in
      the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal, peering out from under the pulled-down brim of his Stetson,
      looked critically at the sleepy horse standing near the open door of the
      Paradise and sought its brand, but in vain, for it was standing with the
      wrong side towards him. Then he glanced at the man in the door, a puzzled
      expression stealing over his face. He had known that man once, but time
      and events had wiped him nearly out of his memory and he could not place
      him. He decided that the other horse could wait until he had sold the one
      he was on, and, stopping before the door of the Paradise, he raised his
      left arm, his right arm lying close to his side, not far from the holster
      on his thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen an' feller-citizens,&rdquo; he began: &ldquo;As marshal of this booming
      city, I am about to offer for sale to the highest bidder this A Number 1
      piebald, pursooant to the decree of the local court an' with the sanction
      of the town council an' the mayor. This same sale is for to pay the town
      for the board an' keep of this animal, an' to square the fine in such
      cases made an' provided. It's sound in wind an' limb, fourteen han's high,
      an' in all ways a beautiful piece of hoss-flesh. Now, gentlemen, how much
      am I bid for this cayuse? Remember, before you make me any offer, that
      this animal is broke to punching cows an' is a first-class cayuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in the Paradise had flocked out into the street and oozed along
      the front of the building, while the stranger now leaned carelessly
      against his own horse, critically looking over the one on sale. Fisher,
      uneasy and worried, squirmed close at hand and glanced covertly from his
      horse and saddle to the guns in the belts on the members of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the stranger who broke the silence: &ldquo;Two bits I bid&mdash;two
      bits,&rdquo; he said, very quietly, whereat the crowd indulged in a faint
      snicker and a few nudges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal looked at him and then ignored him. &ldquo;How much, gentlemen?&rdquo; he
      asked, facing the crowd again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bits,&rdquo; repeated the stranger, as the crowd remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two bits!&rdquo; yelled the marshal, glaring at him angrily: &ldquo;<i>Two bits!</i>
      Why, the <i>look</i> in this cayuse's eyes is worth four! Look at the
      spirit in them eyes, look at the intelligence! The saddle alone is worth a
      clean forty dollars of any man's money. I am out here to sell this animal
      to the highest bidder; the sale's begun, an' I want bids, not jokes. Now,
      who'll start it off?&rdquo; he demanded, glancing around; but no one had
      anything to say except the terse stranger, who appeared to be getting
      irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a starter&mdash;I've given you a bid. I bid two bits&mdash;t-w-o
      b-i-t-s, twenty-five cents. Now go ahead with yore auction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marshal thought he saw an attempt at humor, and since he was feeling
      quite happy, and since he knew that good humor is conducive to good
      bidding, he smiled, all the time, however, racking his memory for the name
      of the humorist. So he accepted the bid: &ldquo;All right, this gentleman bids
      two bits. Two bits I am bid&mdash;two bits. Twenty-five cents. Who'll make
      it twenty-five dollars? Two bits&mdash;who says twenty-five dollars? Ah,
      did <i>you</i> say twenty-five dollars?&rdquo; he snapped, leveling an accusing
      and threatening fore-finger at the man nearest him, who squirmed
      restlessly and glanced at the stranger. &ldquo;<i>Did you say twenty-five
      dollars?</i>&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger came to the rescue. &ldquo;He did not. He hasn't opened his mouth.
      But <i>I</i> said twenty-five <i>cents</i>,&rdquo; quietly observed the
      humorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll gimme thirty? Who'll gimme thirty dollars? Did I hear thirty
      dollars? Did I hear twenty-five dollars bid? Who said thirty dollars? Did
      <i>you</i> say twenty-five dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he when he was talking politics to the man behind him?&rdquo; asked
      the stranger. &ldquo;I said two bits,&rdquo; he added complacently, as he watched the
      auctioneer closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want twenty-five dollars&mdash;an' you shut yore blasted mouth!&rdquo;
       snapped the marshal at the persistent twenty-five-cent man. He did not see
      the fire smouldering in the squinting eyes so alertly watching him.
      &ldquo;Twenty-five dollars&mdash;not a cent less takes the cayuse. Why,
      gentlemen, he's worth twenty in <i>cans</i>! Gimme twenty-five dollars,
      somebody. <i>I</i> bid twenty-five. I want thirty. I want thirty,
      gentlemen; you must gimme thirty. <i>I</i> bid twenty-five dollars&mdash;who's
      going to make it thirty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show us yore twenty-five an' she's yourn,&rdquo; remarked the stranger, with
      exasperating assurance, while Fisher grew pale with excitement. The
      stranger was standing clear of his horse now, and alert readiness was
      stamped all over him. &ldquo;You accepted my bid&mdash;show yore twenty-five
      dollars or take my two bits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You close that face of yourn!&rdquo; exploded the marshal, angrily. &ldquo;I don't
      mind a little fun, but you've got altogether too damned much to say.
      You've queered the bidding, an' now you shut up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said two bits an' I mean just that. You show yore twenty-five or gimme
      that cayuse on my bid,&rdquo; retorted the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the pans of Julius Caesar!&rdquo; shouted the marshal. &ldquo;I'll put you to
      sleep so you'll never wake up if I hears any more about you an' yore two
      bits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me, Rednose,&rdquo; snapped the other, his gun out in a flash. &ldquo;I want
      that cayuse, an' I want it quick. You show me twenty-five dollars or I'll
      take it out from under you on my bid, you yaller dog! <i>Stop it!</i> Shut
      up! That's suicide, that is. Others have tried it an' failed, an' yo're no
      sleight-of-hand gun-man. This is the first time I ever paid a hoss-thief
      in <i>silver</i>, or bought stolen goods, but everything has to have a
      beginning. You get nervous with that hand of yourn an' I'll cure you of
      it! Git off that piebald, an' quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marshal felt stunned and groped for a way out, but the gun under his
      nose was as steady as a rock. He sat there stupidly, not knowing enough to
      obey orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, get off that cayuse,&rdquo; sharply commanded the stranger. &ldquo;An' I'll
      take yore Winchester as a fine for this high-handed business you've been
      carrying on. You may be the local court an' all the town officials, but
      I'm the Governor, an' here's my Supreme Court, as I was saying to the boys
      a little while ago. Yo're overruled. Get off that cayuse, an' don't waste
      no more time about it, neither!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marshal glared into the muzzle of the weapon and felt a sinking in the
      pit of his stomach. Never before had he failed to anticipate the pull of a
      gun. As the stranger said, there must always be a beginning, a first time.
      He was thinking quickly now; he was master of himself again, but he
      realized that he was in a tight place unless he obeyed the man with the
      drop. Not a man in town would help him; on the other hand, they were all
      against him, and hugely enjoying his discomfiture. With some men he could
      afford to take chances and jerk at his gun even when at such a
      disadvantage, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;what's yore name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd listened eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <i>friends</i> call me Hopalong Cassidy; other people, other things&mdash;you
      gimme that cayuse an' that Winchester. Here! Hand the gun to Fisher, so
      there won't be no lamentable accidents: I don't want to shoot you, 'less I
      have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're both yourn,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Townsend, remembering a certain day over
      near Alameda, when he had seen Mr. Cassidy at gun-play. He dismounted
      slowly and sorrowfully. &ldquo;Do I&mdash;do I get my two bits?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shore do&mdash;yore gall is worth it,&rdquo; said Mr. Cassidy, turning the
      piebald over to its overjoyed owner, who was already arranging further
      gambling with his friend, the bartender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Townsend pocketed the one bid, surveyed glumly the hilarious crowd
      flocking in to the bar to drink to their joy in his defeat, and wandered
      disconsolately back to the pound. He was never again seen in that
      locality, or by any of the citizens of Rawhide, for between dark and dawn
      he resumed his travels, bound for some locality far removed from limping,
      red-headed drawbacks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JOHNNY LEARNS SOMETHING
    </h3>
    <p>
      For several weeks after Hopalong got back to the ranch, full of
      interesting stories and minus the grouch, things went on in a way placid
      enough for the most peacefully inclined individual that ever sat a saddle.
      And then trouble drifted down from the north and caused a look of anxiety
      to spoil Buck Peters' pleasant expression, and began to show on the faces
      of his men. When one finds the carcasses of two cows on the same day, and
      both are skinned, there can be only one conclusion. The killing and
      skinning of two cows out of herds that are numbered by thousands need not,
      in themselves, bring lines of worry to any foreman's brow; but there is
      the sting of being cheated, the possibility of the losses going higher
      unless a sharp lesson be given upon the folly of fooling with a very keen
      and active buzz-saw,&mdash;and it was the determination of the outfit of
      the Bar-20 to teach that lesson, and as quickly as circumstances would
      permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was common knowledge that there was a more or less organized band of
      shiftless malcontents making its headquarters in and near Perry's Bend,
      some distance up the river, and the deduction in this case was easy. The
      Bar-20 cared very little about what went on at Perry's Bend&mdash;that was
      a matter which concerned only the ranches near that town&mdash;as long as
      no vexatious happenings sifted too far south. But they had so sifted, and
      Perry's Bend, or rather the undesirable class hanging out there, was due
      to receive a shock before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a week after the finding of the first skinned cows, Pete Wilson
      tornadoed up to the bunk house with a perforated arm. Pete was on foot,
      having lost his horse at the first exchange of shots, which accounts for
      the expression describing his arrival. Pete hated to walk, he hated still
      more to get shot, and most of all he hated to have to admit that his
      rifle-shooting was so far below par. He had seen the thief at work and,
      too eager to work up close to the cattle skinner before announcing his
      displeasure, had missed the first shot. When he dragged himself out from
      under his deceased horse the scenery was undisturbed save for a small
      cloud of dust hovering over a distant rise to the north of him. After
      delivering a short and bitter monologue he struck out for the ranch and
      arrived in a very hot and wrathful condition. It was contagious, that
      condition, and before long the entire outfit was in the saddle and
      pounding north, Pete overjoyed because his wound was so slight as not to
      bar him from the chase. The shock was on the way, and as events proved,
      was to be one long to linger in the minds of the inhabitants of Perry's
      Bend and the surrounding range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patrons of the Oasis liked their tobacco strong. The pungent smoke
      drifted in sluggish clouds along the low, black ceiling, following its
      upward slant toward the east wall and away from the high bar at the other
      end. This bar, rough and strong, ran from the north wall to within a scant
      two feet of the south wall, the opening bridged by a hinged board which
      served as an extension to the counter. Behind the bar was a rear door, low
      and double, the upper part barred securely&mdash;the lower part was used
      most. In front of and near the bar was a large round table, at which four
      men played cards silently, while two smaller tables were located along the
      north wall. Besides dilapidated chairs there were half a dozen low wooden
      boxes partly filled with sand, and attention was directed to the existence
      and purpose of these by a roughly lettered sign on the wall, reading:
      &ldquo;Gents will look for a box first,&rdquo; which the &ldquo;gents&rdquo; sometimes did. The
      majority of the &ldquo;gents&rdquo; preferred to aim at various knotholes in the floor
      and bet on the result, chancing the outpouring of the proprietor's wrath
      if they missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall behind the bar was a smaller and neater request: &ldquo;Leave your
      guns with the bartender.&mdash;Edwards.&rdquo; This, although a month old, still
      called forth caustic and profane remarks from the regular frequenters of
      the saloon, for hitherto restraint in the matter of carrying weapons had
      been unknown. They forthwith evaded the order in a manner consistent with
      their characteristics&mdash;by carrying smaller guns where they could not
      be seen. The majority had simply sawed off a generous part of the long
      barrels of their Colts and Remingtons, which did not improve their
      accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwards, the new marshal of Perry's Bend, had come direct from Kansas and
      his reputation as a fighter had preceded him. When he took up his first
      day's work he was kept busy proving that he was the rightful owner of it
      and that it had not been exaggerated in any manner or degree. With the
      exception of one instance the proof had been bloodless, for he reasoned
      that gun-play should give way, whenever possible, to a crushing &ldquo;right&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;left&rdquo; to the point of the jaw or the pit of the stomach. His proficiency
      in the manly art was polished and thorough and bespoke earnest
      application. The last doubting Thomas to be convinced came to five minutes
      after his diaphragm had been rudely and suddenly raised several inches by
      a low right hook, and as he groped for his bearings and got his wind back
      again he asked, very feebly, where &ldquo;Kansas&rdquo; was; and the name stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harlan heard the nickname for the first time he stopped pulling the
      cork out of a whiskey bottle long enough to remark, casually, &ldquo;I allus
      reckoned Kansas was purty close to hell,&rdquo; and said no more about it.
      Harlan was the proprietor and bartender of the Oasis and catered to the
      excessive and uncritical thirsts of the ruck of range society, and he had
      objected vigorously to the placing of the second sign in his place of
      business; but at the close of an incisive if inelegant reply from the
      marshal, the sign went up, and stayed up. Edwards' language and delivery
      were as convincing as his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal did not like the Oasis; indeed, he went further and cordially
      hated it. Harlan's saloon was a thorn in his side and he was only waiting
      for a good excuse to wipe it off the local map. He was the Law, and behind
      him were the range riders, who would be only too glad to have the nest of
      rustlers wiped out and its gang of ne'er-do-wells scattered to the four
      winds. Indeed, he had been given to understand in a most polite and
      diplomatic way that if this were not done lawfully they would try to do it
      themselves, and they had great faith in their ability to handle the
      situation in a thorough and workmanlike manner. This would not do in a
      law-abiding community, as he called the town, and so he had replied that
      the work was his, and that it would be performed as soon as he believed
      himself justified to act. Harlan and his friends were fully conversant
      with the feeling against them and had become a little more cautious,
      alertly watching out for trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day which saw Pete Wilson's discomfiture most of the
      habitues had assembled in the Oasis where, besides the card-players
      already mentioned, eight men lounged against the bar. There was some
      laughter, much subdued talking, and a little whispering. More whispering
      went on under that roof than in all the other places in town put together;
      for here rustling was planned, wayfaring strangers were &ldquo;trimmed&rdquo; in
      &ldquo;frame-ups&rdquo; at cards, and a hunted man was certain to find assistance.
      Harlan had once boasted that no fugitive had ever been taken from his
      saloon, and he was behind the bar and standing on the trap door which led
      to the six-by-six cellar when he made the assertion. It was true, for only
      those in his confidence knew of the place of refuge under the floor; it
      had been dug at night and the dirt carefully disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not been dark very long before talking ceased and card-playing was
      suspended while all looked up as the front door crashed open and two
      punchers entered, looking the crowd over with critical care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here, Johnny,&rdquo; Hopalong told his youthful companion, and then walked
      forward, scrutinizing each scowling face in turn, while Johnny stood with
      his back to the door, keenly alert, his right hand resting lightly on his
      belt not far from the holster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan's thick neck grew crimson and his eyes hard. &ldquo;Looking fer
      something?&rdquo; he asked with bitter sarcasm, his hands under the bar. Johnny
      grinned hopefully and a sudden tenseness took possession of him as he
      watched for the first hostile move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hopalong replied coolly, appraising Harlan's attitude and look in
      one swift glance, &ldquo;but it ain't here, now. Johnny, get out,&rdquo; he ordered,
      backing after his companion, and safely outside, the two walked towards
      Jackson's store, Johnny complaining about the little time spent in the
      Oasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the store they saw Edwards, whose eye asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he ain't in there yet,&rdquo; Hopalong replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you look all over? Behind the bar?&rdquo; Edwards asked, slowly. &ldquo;He can't
      get out of town through that cordon you've got strung around it, an' he
      ain't nowhere else. Leastwise, I couldn't find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on back!&rdquo; excitedly exclaimed Johnny, turning towards the door. &ldquo;You
      didn't look behind the bar! Come on&mdash;bet you ten dollars that's where
      he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby yo're right, Kid,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, and the marshal's nodding head
      decided it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the saloon there was strong language, and Jack Quinn, expert skinner of
      other men's cows, looked inquiringly at the proprietor. &ldquo;What's up now,
      Harlan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor laughed harshly but said nothing&mdash;taciturnity was his
      one redeeming trait. &ldquo;Did you say cigars?&rdquo; he asked, pushing a box across
      the bar to an impatient customer. Another beckoned to him and he leaned
      over to hear the whispered request, a frown struggling to show itself on
      his face. &ldquo;Nix; you know my rule. No trust in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man at the far end of the line was unlike the proprietor and he
      prefaced his remarks with a curse. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know what's up! They want
      Jerry Brown, that's what! An' I hopes they don't get him, the bullies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do? Why do they want him?&rdquo; asked the man who had wanted
      trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinning. He was careless or crazy, working so close to their ranch
      houses. Nobody that had any sense would take a chance like that,&rdquo; replied
      Boston, adept at sleight-of-hand with cards and very much in demand when a
      frame-up was to be rung in on some unsuspecting stranger. His one great
      fault in the eyes of his partners was that he hated to divvy his winnings
      and at times had to be coerced into sharing equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, them big ranches make me mad,&rdquo; announced the first speaker. &ldquo;Ten
      years ago there was a lot of little ranchers, an' every one of 'em had his
      own herd, an' plenty of free grass an' water for it. Where are the little
      herds now? Where are the cows that <i>we</i> used to own?&rdquo; he cried,
      hotly. &ldquo;What happens to a maverick-hunter now-a-days? By God, if a man
      helps hisself to a pore, sick dogie he's hunted down! It can't go on much
      longer, an' that's shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cries of approbation arose on all sides, for his auditors ignored the fact
      that their kind, by avarice and thievery, had forever killed the
      occupation of maverick-hunting. That belonged to the old days, before the
      demand for cows and their easy and cheap transportation had boosted the
      prices and made them valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slivers Lowe leaped up from his chair. &ldquo;Yo're right, Harper! Dead right!
      <i>I</i> was a little cattle owner once, so was you, an' Jerry, an' most
      of us!&rdquo; Slivers found it convenient to forget that fully half of his small
      herd had perished in the bitter and long winter of five years before, and
      that the remainder had either flowed down his parched throat or been lost
      across the big round table near the bar. Not a few of his cows were banked
      in the east under Harlan's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rear door opened slightly and one of the loungers looked up and
      nodded. &ldquo;It's all right, Jerry. But get a move on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, <i>you</i>!&rdquo; called Harlan, quickly bending over the trap door, &ldquo;<i>Lively!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jerry was half way to the proprietor when the front door swung open and
      Hopalong, closely followed by the marshal, leaped into the room, and
      immediately thereafter the back door banged open and admitted Johnny.
      Jerry's right hand was in his side coat pocket and Johnny, young and
      self-confident, and with a lot to learn, was certain that he could beat
      the fugitive on the draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you won't blot no more brands!&rdquo; he cried, triumphantly, watching
      both Jerry and Harlan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The card-players had leaped to their feet and at a signal from Harlan they
      surged forward to the bar and formed a barrier between Johnny and his
      friends; and as they did so that puncher jerked at his gun, twisting to
      half face the crowd. At that instant fire and smoke spurted from Jerry's
      side coat pocket and the odor of burning cloth arose. As Johnny fell, the
      rustler ducked low and sprang for the door. A gun roared twice in the
      front of the room and Jerry staggered a little and cursed as he gained the
      opening, but he plunged into the darkness and threw himself into the
      saddle on the first horse he found in the small corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the crowd massed, Hopalong leaped at it and strove to tear his way to
      the opening at the end of the bar, while the marshal covered Harlan and
      the others. Finding that he could not get through. Hopalong sprang on the
      shoulder of the nearest man and succeeded in winging the fugitive at the
      first shot, the other going wild. Then, frantic with rage and anxiety, he
      beat his way through the crowd, hammering mercilessly at heads with the
      butt of his Colt, and knelt at his friend's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwards, angered almost to the point of killing, ordered the crowd to
      stand against the wall, and laughed viciously when he saw two men
      senseless on the floor. &ldquo;Hope he beat in yore heads!&rdquo; he gritted,
      savagely. &ldquo;Harlan, put yore paws up in sight or I'll drill you clean! Now
      climb over an' get in line&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny moaned and opened his eyes. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did I&mdash;get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but he gimleted you, all right,&rdquo; Hopalong replied. &ldquo;You'll come
      'round if you keep quiet.&rdquo; He arose, his face hard with the desire to
      kill. &ldquo;I'm coming back for <i>you</i>, Harlan, after I get yore friend!
      An' all the rest of you pups, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me out of here,&rdquo; whispered Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore enough, Kid; but keep quiet,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, picking him up in
      his arms and moving carefully towards the door. &ldquo;We'll get him, Johnny;
      an' all the rest, too, when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The voice died out in the
      direction of Jackson's and the marshal, backing to the front door, slipped
      out and to one side, running backward, his eyes on the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yore day's about over, Harlan,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There's going to be some
      few funerals around here before many hours pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the store he found the owner and two Double-Arrow punchers
      taking care of Johnny. &ldquo;Where's Hopalong?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to tell his foreman,&rdquo; replied Jackson. &ldquo;Hey, youngster, you let them
      bandages alone! Hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Kansas,&rdquo; remarked John Bartlett, foreman of the Double-Arrow. &ldquo;I
      come nigh getting yore man; somebody rode past me like a streak in the
      dark, so I just ups an' lets drive for luck, an' so did he. I heard him
      cuss an' I emptied my gun after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest was a-passing the word along to ride in when I left the line,&rdquo;
       remarked one of the other punchers. &ldquo;How you feeling now, Johnny?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE END OF THE TRAIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rain slanted down in sheets and the broken plain, thoroughly
      saturated, held the water in pools or sent it down the steep sides of the
      arroyo, to feed the turbulent flood which swept along the bottom,
      foam-flecked and covered with swiftly moving driftwood. Around a bend in
      the arroyo, where the angry water flung itself against the ragged bulwark
      of rock and flashed away in a gleaming line of foam, a horseman appeared
      bending low in the saddle for better protection against the storm. He rode
      along the edge of the stream on the farther bank, opposite the steep bluff
      on the northern side, forcing his wounded and jaded horse to keep fetlock
      deep in the water which swirled and sucked about its legs. He was trying
      his hardest to hide his trail. Lower down the hard, rocky ground extended
      to the water's edge, and if he could delay his pursuers for an hour or so,
      he felt that, even with his tired horse, he would have more than an even
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had gained more than he knew. Suddenly above him on the top of
      the steep bluff across the torrent a man loomed up against the clouds,
      peered intently into the arroyo, and then waved his sombrero to an unseen
      companion. A puff of smoke flashed from his shoulder and streaked away,
      the report of the shot lost in the gale. The fugitive's horse reared and
      plunged into the deep water and with its rider was swept rapidly towards
      the bend, the way they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes the fourth time I've missed that coyote!&rdquo; angrily exclaimed
      Hopalong as Red Connors joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other quickly raised his rifle and fired; and the horse, spilling its
      rider out of the saddle, floated away tail first. The fugitive, gripping
      his rifle, bobbed and whirled at the whim of the greedy water as shots
      struck near him. Making a desperate effort, he staggered up the bank and
      fell exhausted behind a boulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the coyote is afoot, anyhow,&rdquo; said Red, with great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but how are we going to get to him?&rdquo; asked Hopalong. &ldquo;We can't get
      the cayuses down here, an' we can't swim <i>that</i> water without them.
      An' if we could, he'd pot us easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a way out of it somewhere,&rdquo; Red replied, disappearing over the
      edge of the bluff to gamble with Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Come back here, you chump!&rdquo; cried Hopalong, running forward. &ldquo;He'll
      get you, shore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a chance I've got to take if I get him,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      A puff of smoke sailed from behind the boulder on the other bank and
      Hopalong, kneeling for steadier aim, fired and then followed his friend.
      Red was downstream casting at a rock across the torrent but the wind toyed
      with the heavy, water-soaked <i>reata</i> as though it were a string. As
      Hopalong reached his side a piece of driftwood ducked under the water and
      an angry humming sound died away downstream. As the report reached their
      ears a jet of water spurted up into Red's face and he stepped back
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's so shaky,&rdquo; Hopalong remarked, looking back at the wreath of smoke
      above the boulder. &ldquo;I reckon I must have hit him harder than I thought in
      Harlan's. Gee! He's wild as blazes!&rdquo; he yelled as a bullet hummed high
      above his head and struck sharply against the rock wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Red replied, coiling the rope. &ldquo;I was trying to rope that rock over
      there. If I could anchor to that, the current would push us over quick.
      But it's too far with this wind blowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't do nothing here 'cept get plugged. He'll be getting steadier as
      he rests from his fight with the water,&rdquo; Hopalong remarked, and added
      quickly, &ldquo;Say, remember that meadow back there a ways? We can make her
      from there, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're right; that's what we've got to do. He's sending 'em nearer every
      shot&mdash;Gee! I could 'most feel the wind of that one. An' blamed if it
      ain't stopped raining. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clambered up the slippery, muddy bank to where they had left their
      horses, and cantered back over their trail. Minute after minute passed
      before the cautious skulker among the rocks across the stream could
      believe in his good fortune. When he at last decided that he was alone
      again he left his shelter and started away, with slowly weakening stride,
      over cleanly washed rock where he left no trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon before the two irate punchers appeared upon
      the scene, and their comments, as they hunted slowly over the hard ground,
      were numerous and bitter. Deciding that it was hopeless in that vicinity,
      they began casting in great circles on the chance of crossing the trail
      further back from the river. But they had little faith in their success.
      As Red remarked, snorting like a horse in his disgust, &ldquo;I'll bet four
      dollars an' a match he's swum down the river clean to hell just to have
      the laugh on us.&rdquo; Red had long since given it up as a bad job, though
      continuing to search, when a shout from the distant Hopalong sent him
      forward on a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Red!&rdquo; cried Hopalong, pointing ahead of them. &ldquo;Look there! Ain't
      that a house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw; course not! It's a&mdash;it's a ship!&rdquo; Red snorted sarcastically.
      &ldquo;What did you think it might be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G'wan!&rdquo; retorted his companion. &ldquo;It's a mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, g'wan yoreself! What's a mission doing up here?&rdquo; Red snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think they do? What do they do anywhere?&rdquo; hotly rejoined
      Hopalong, thinking about Johnny. &ldquo;There! See the cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' there's tracks at last&mdash;mighty wobbly, but tracks just the same.
      Them rocks couldn't go on forever. Red, I'll bet he's cashed in by this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cashed nothing! Them fellers don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he's in that joint we might as well go back home. We won't get
      him, not nohow,&rdquo; declared Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! You wait an' see!&rdquo; replied Red, pugnaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you never run up agin a mission real hard,&rdquo; Hopalong responded,
      his memory harking back to the time he had disagreed with a convent, and
      they both meant about the same to him as far as winning out was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think I'm a fool kid?&rdquo; snapped Red, aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ain't no <i>kid</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let <i>me</i> do the talking; <i>I'll</i> get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; an' I'll do the laughing,&rdquo; snickered Hopalong, at the door.
      &ldquo;Sic 'em, Red!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boldly stepped into a small vestibule, Hopalong close at his
      heels. Red hitched his holster and walked heavily into a room at his left.
      With the exception of a bench, a table, and a small altar, the room was
      devoid of furnishings, and the effect of these was lost in the dim light
      from the narrow windows. The peculiar, not unpleasant odor of burning
      incense and the dim light awakened a latent reverence and awe in Hopalong,
      and he sneaked off his sombrero, an inexplicable feeling of guilt stealing
      over him. There were three doors in the walls, deeply shrouded in the dusk
      of the room, and it was very hard to watch all three at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red was peering into the dark corners, his hand on the butt of his Colt,
      and hardly knew what he was looking for. &ldquo;This joint must 'a' looked plumb
      good to that coyote, all right. He had a hell of a lot of luck, but he
      won't keep it for long, damn him!&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit cussing!&rdquo; tersely ordered Hopalong. &ldquo;An' for God's sake, throw out
      that damned cigarette! Ain't you got no manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red listened intently and then grinned. &ldquo;Hear that? They're playing
      dominoes in there&mdash;come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you chump! 'Dominee' means 'mother' in Latin, which is what they
      speaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I can tell&mdash;I've heard it somewhere, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't care what it means. This is a frame-up so that coyote can
      get away. I'll bet they gave him a cayuse an' started him off while we've
      been losing time in here. I'm going inside an' ask some questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could put his plan into execution, Hopalong nudged him and he
      turned to see his friend staring at one of the doors. There had been no
      sound, but he would swear that a monk stood gravely regarding them, and he
      rubbed his eyes. He stepped back suspiciously and then started forward
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, stranger,&rdquo; he remarked, with quiet emphasis, &ldquo;we're after that
      cow-lifter, an' we mean to get him. Savvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monk did not appear to hear him, so he tried another tack. &ldquo;<i>Habla
      Espanola?</i>&rdquo; he asked, experimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ridden far?&rdquo; replied the monk in perfect English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the way from the Bend,&rdquo; Red replied, relieved. &ldquo;We're after Jerry
      Brown. He tried to kill Johnny, an' near made good. An' I reckon we've
      treed him, judging from the tracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you capture him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't have no more use for no side pocket shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; you will kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore's it's wet outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you are doomed to disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya-as?&rdquo; asked Red with a rising inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not want him now,&rdquo; replied the monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red laughed sarcastically and Hopalong smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't a-going to be no argument about it. Trot him out,&rdquo; ordered
      Red, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk turned to Hopalong. &ldquo;Do you, too, want him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, he is safe from your punishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red wheeled instantly and ran outside, returning in a few moments, smiling
      triumphantly. &ldquo;There are tracks coming in, but there ain't none going
      away. He's here. If you don't lead us to him we'll shore have to rummage
      around an' poke him out for ourselves: which is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;he is here, and he is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're waiting,&rdquo; Red replied, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I tell you that you will not want him, do you still insist on seeing
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see him, an' we'll want him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the rain poured down again the sound of approaching horses was heard,
      and Hopalong ran to the door in time to see Buck Peters swing off his
      mount and step forward to enter the building. Hopalong stopped him and
      briefly outlined the situation, begging him to keep the men outside. The
      monk met his return with a grateful smile and, stepping forward, opened
      the chapel door, saying, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unpretentious chapel was small and nearly dark, for the usual dimness
      was increased by the lowering clouds outside. The deep, narrow window
      openings, fitted with stained glass, ran almost to the rough-hewn rafters
      supporting the steep-pitched roof, upon which the heavy rain beat again
      with a sound like that of distant drums. Gusts of rain and the water from
      the roof beat against the south windows, while the wailing wind played its
      mournful cadences about the eaves, and the stanch timbers added their
      creaking notes to swell the dirge-like chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end of the room two figures knelt and moved before the
      white altar, the soft light of flickering candles playing fitfully upon
      them and glinting from the altar ornaments, while before a rough coffin,
      which rested upon two pedestals, stood a third, whose rich, sonorous Latin
      filled the chapel with impressive sadness. &ldquo;Give eternal rest to them, O
      Lord,&rdquo;&mdash;the words seeming to become a part of the room. The ineffably
      sad, haunting melody of the mass whispered back from the room between the
      assaults of the enraged wind, while from the altar came the responses in a
      low, Gregorian chant, and through it all the clinking of the censer chains
      added intermittent notes. Aloft streamed the vapor of the incense,
      wavering with the air currents, now lost in the deep twilight of the
      sanctuary, and now faintly revealed by the glow of the candles, perfuming
      the air with its aromatic odor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last deep-toned words died away the celebrant moved slowly around
      the coffin, swinging the censer over it and then, sprinkling the body and
      making the sign of the cross above its head, solemnly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the shadows along the side walls other figures silently emerged and
      grouped around the coffin. Raising it they turned it slowly around and
      carried it down the dim aisle in measured tread, moving silently as
      ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is with God, Who will punish according to his sins,&rdquo; said a low voice,
      and Hopalong started, for he had forgotten the presence of the guide. &ldquo;God
      be with you, and may you die as he died&mdash;repentant and in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buck chafed impatiently before the chapel door leading to a small,
      well-kept graveyard, wondering what it was that kept quiet for so long a
      time his two most assertive men, when he had momentarily expected to hear
      more or less turmoil and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>C-r-e-a-k!</i> He glanced up, gun in hand and raised as the door swung
      slowly open. His hand dropped suddenly and he took a short step forward;
      six black-robed figures shouldering a long box stepped slowly past him,
      and his nostrils were assailed by the pungent odor of the incense. Behind
      them came his fighting punchers, humble, awed, reverent, their sombreros
      in their hands, and their heads bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in blazes!&rdquo; exclaimed Buck, wonder and surprise struggling for the
      mastery as the others cantered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's cashed,&rdquo; Red replied, putting on his sombrero and nodding toward the
      procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buck turned like a flash and spoke sharply: &ldquo;Skinny! Lanky! Follow that
      glory-outfit, an' see what's in that box!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy Williams grinned at Red. &ldquo;Yo're shore pious, Red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; snapped Red, anger glinting in his eyes, and Billy subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanky and Skinny soon returned from accompanying the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to look twice to be shore it was him. His face was plumb happy,
      like a baby. But he's gone, all right,&rdquo; Lanky reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deader'n hell,&rdquo; remarked Skinny, looking around curiously. &ldquo;This here is
      some shack, ain't it?&rdquo; he finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;he knowed how he'd finish when he began. Now for that
      dear Mr. Harlan,&rdquo; Buck replied, vaulting into the saddle. He turned and
      looked at Hopalong, and his wonder grew. &ldquo;Hey, <i>you</i>! Yes, <i>you</i>!
      Come out of that an' put on yore lid! Straddle leather&mdash;we can't stay
      here all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong started, looked at his sombrero and silently obeyed. As they rode
      down the trail and around a corner he turned in his saddle and looked
      back; and then rode on, buried in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, grinning, turned and playfully punched him in the ribs. &ldquo;Getting
      glory, Hoppy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong raised his head and looked him steadily in the eyes; and Billy,
      losing his curiosity and the grin at the same instant, looked ahead,
      whistling softly.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EDWARDS' ULTIMATUM
    </h3>
    <p>
      Edwards slid off the counter in Jackson's store and glowered at the
      pelting rain outside, perturbed and grouchy. The wounded man in the corner
      stirred and looked at him without interest and forthwith renewed his
      profane monologue, while the proprietor, finishing his task, leaned back
      against the shelves and swore softly. It was a lovely atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me they've been gone a long time,&rdquo; grumbled the wounded man.
      &ldquo;Reckon he led 'em a long chase&mdash;had six hours' start, the toad.&rdquo; He
      paused and then as an afterthought said with conviction: &ldquo;But they'll get
      him&mdash;they allus do when they make up their minds to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwards nodded moodily and Jackson replied with a monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I could 'a' gone with 'em,&rdquo; Johnny growled. &ldquo;I like to square my own
      accounts. It's allus that way. I get plugged an' my friends clean the
      slate. There was that time Bye-an'-Bye went an' ambushed me&mdash;ah, the
      devil! But I tell you one thing: when I get well I'm going down to
      Harlan's an' clean house proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're in hard luck again: that'll be done as soon as yore friends get
      back,&rdquo; Jackson replied, carefully selecting a dried apricot from a box on
      the counter and glancing at the marshal to see how he took the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be done before then,&rdquo; Edwards said crisply, with the air of a man
      who has just settled a doubt. &ldquo;They won't be back much before to-morrow if
      he headed for the country I think he did. I'm going down to the Oasis an'
      tell that gang to clear out of this town. They've been here too long now.
      I never had 'em dead to rights before, but I've got it on 'em this time.
      I'd 'a' sent 'em packing yesterday only I sort of hated to take a man's
      business away from him an' make him lose his belongings. But I've wrastled
      it all out an' they've got to go.&rdquo; He buttoned his coat about him and
      pulled his sombrero more firmly on his head, starting for the door. &ldquo;I'll
      be back soon,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder as he grasped the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better wait till you get help&mdash;there's too many down there for
      one man to watch an' handle,&rdquo; Jackson hastily remarked. &ldquo;Here, I'll go
      with you,&rdquo; he offered, looking for his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwards laughed shortly. &ldquo;You stay here. I do my own work by myself when I
      can&mdash;that's what I'm here for, an' I can do this, all right. If I
      took any help they'd reckon I was scared,&rdquo; and the door slammed shut
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got sand a plenty,&rdquo; Jackson remarked. &ldquo;He'd try to push back a
      stampede by main strength if he reckoned it was his duty. It's his good
      luck that he wasn't killed long ago&mdash;<i>I'd</i> 'a' been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're a bunch of cowards,&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;As long as you ain't afraid
      of 'em, none of 'em wants to start anything. Bunch of sheep!&rdquo; he snorted.
      &ldquo;Didn't Jerry shoot me through his pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' yo're another lucky dog,&rdquo; Jackson responded, having in mind that
      at first Johnny had been thought to be desperately wounded. &ldquo;Why, yore
      friends have got the worst of this game; they're worse off than you are&mdash;out
      all day an' night in this cussed storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they talked Edwards made his way through the cold downpour to
      Harlan's saloon, alone and unafraid, and greatly pleased by the order he
      would give. At last he had proof enough to work on, to satisfy his
      conscience, for the inevitable had come as the culmination of continued
      and clever defiance of law and order.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deliberately approached the front door of the Oasis and, opening it,
      stepped inside, his hands resting on his guns&mdash;he had packed two
      Colts for the last twenty-four hours. His appearance caused a ripple of
      excitement to run around the room. After what had taken place, a visit
      from him could mean only one thing&mdash;trouble. And it was entirely
      possible that he had others within call to help him out if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan knew that he would be the one held responsible and he ceased wiping
      a glass and held the cloth suspended in one hand and the glass in the
      other. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he snapped, angrily, his eyes smouldering with fixed
      hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby you think it's well, but it's going to be a blamed sight better
      before sundown to-morrow night,&rdquo; evenly replied the marshal. &ldquo;I just
      dropped in sort of free-like to tell you to pack up an' get out of town
      before dark&mdash;load yore wagon an' vamoose; an' take yore friends with
      you, too. If you don't&mdash;&rdquo; he did not finish in words, for his
      tightening lips made them unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; yelled Harlan, red with anger. He placed his hands on the
      bar and leaned over it as if to give emphasis to his words. &ldquo;<i>Me</i>
      pack up an' git! <i>Me</i> leave this shack! Who's going to pay me for it,
      hey? <i>Me</i> leave town! You drop out again an' go back to Kansas where
      you come from&mdash;they're easier back there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so far I ain't found nothing very craggy 'round here,&rdquo; retorted
      Edwards, closely watching the muttering crowd by the bar. &ldquo;Takes more than
      a loud voice an' a pack of sneaking coyotes to send me looking for
      something easier. An' let me tell you this: <i>You</i> stay away from
      Kansas&mdash;they hangs people like you back there. That's whatever. You
      pack up an' git out of this town or I'll start a burying plot with you on
      yore own land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The low, angry buzz of Harlan's friends and their savage, scowling faces
      would have deterred a less determined man; but Edwards knew they were
      afraid of him, and the men on whom he could call to back him up. And he
      knew that there must always be a start, there must be one man to show the
      way; and each of the men he faced was waiting for some one else to lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all slip over the horizon before dark to-night, an' it's dark early
      these days,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;<i>Don't get restless with yore hands!</i>&rdquo; he
      snapped ominously at the crowd. &ldquo;I means what I say&mdash;you shake the
      mud from this town off yore boots before dark&mdash;before that Bar-20
      outfit gets back,&rdquo; he finished meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Questions, imprecations, and threats filled the room, and the crowd began
      to spread out slowly. His guns came out like a flash and he laughed with
      the elation that comes with impending battle. &ldquo;The first man to start
      it'll drop,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;Who's going to be the martyr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>won't</i> leave town!&rdquo; shouted Harlan. &ldquo;I'll stay here if I'm killed
      for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire yore loyalty to principle, but you've got damned little sense,&rdquo;
       retorted the marshal. &ldquo;You ain't no practical man. <i>Keep yore hands
      where they are!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;his vibrant voice turned the shifting crowd to
      stone-like rigidity and he backed slowly toward the door, the poor light
      gleaming dully from the polished blue steel of his Colts. Rugged,
      lion-like, charged to the finger tips with reckless courage and dare-devil
      self-confidence, his personality overflowed and dominated the room, almost
      hypnotic in its effect. He was but one against many, but he was the
      master, and they knew it; they had known it long enough to accept it
      without question, and the training now stood him in good stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood in the open doorway, keenly scrutinizing them for
      signs of danger, his unwavering guns charged with certain death and his
      strong face made stronger by the shadows in its hollows. &ldquo;Before dark!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left behind him deep silence, which endured for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord, I <i>won't</i>!&rdquo; cried Harlan, still staring at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell was broken and a babel of voices filled the room, threats
      mingling with excuses, hot, vibrant, profane. These men were not cowards
      all the way through, but only when face to face with the master. They had
      flourished in a way by their wits alone on the same range with the outfits
      of the C-80 and the Double-Arrow, for individually they were &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; and
      collectively they made a force of no mean strength. Edwards had landed
      among them like a thunderbolt and had proved his prowess, and they still
      held him in awesome respect. His reckless audacity and grim singleness of
      purpose had saved him on more than one occasion, for had he wavered once
      he would have been shot down without mercy. But gradually his enforcement
      of hampering laws became more and more intolerable, and their subordinated
      spirits were nearly on the point of revolt. When he faced them they
      resumed their former positions in relation to him&mdash;but once out of
      his sight they plotted to destroy him. Here was the crisis: it was now or
      never. They could not evade his ultimatum&mdash;it was obey or fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submission was not to be thought of, for to flee would be to lose caste,
      and the story of such an act would follow them wherever they went, and
      brand them as cowards. Here they had lived, and here they would stay if
      possible, and to this end they discussed ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harlan's right!&rdquo; emphatically announced Laramie Joe. &ldquo;We can't pull out
      and have this foller us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should have started it with a rush when he was in here,&rdquo; remarked
      Boston, regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan stopped his pacing and faced them, shoving out a bottle of whiskey
      as an aid to his logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That chance is past, an' I don't know but what it is a good thing,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;He was primed an' looking fer trouble, an' he'd shore got a few of
      us afore he went under. What we want is strategy&mdash;that's the game.
      You fellers have got as much brains as him, an' if we thrash this thing
      out we can find a way to call his play&mdash;an' get him! No use of any of
      us getting plugged 'less we have to. But whatever we do we've got to start
      it right quick an' have it over before that Bar-20 gang comes back.
      Harper, you an' Quinn go scouting&mdash;an' don't take no guns with you,
      neither. Act like you was hitting the long trail out, an' work back here
      on a circle. See how many of his friends are in town. While you are gone
      the rest of us will hold a pow-wow an' take the kinks out of this game.
      Chase along, an' don't waste no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Slivers Lowe emphatically. &ldquo;There's blamed few fellers in
      town now that have any use for him, for most of them are off on the
      ranges. Bet we won't have more than six to fight, an' there's that many of
      us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scouts departed at once and the remaining four drew close in
      consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more drink around and then no more till this trouble is over,&rdquo; Harlan
      said, passing the bottle. The drinks, in view of the coming drought and
      the thirsty work ahead, were long and deep, and new courage and
      vindictiveness crept through their veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here's the way it looks to me,&rdquo; Harlan continued, placing the bottle,
      untasted by himself, on the floor behind him. &ldquo;We've got to work a
      surprise an' take Edwards an' his friends off their guard. That'll be easy
      if we're careful, because they think we ain't looking for fight. When we
      get them out of the way we can take Jackson's store an' use one of the
      other shacks and wait for the Bar-20 to ride in. They'll canter right in,
      like they allus do, an' when they get close enough we'll open the game
      with a volley an' make every shot tell. 'T won't last long, 'cause every
      one of us will have his man named before they get here. Then the few
      straddlers in town, seeing how easy we've gone an' handled it'll join us.
      We've got four men to come in yet, an' by the time the C-80 an'
      Double-Arrow hears about it we'll be fixed to drive 'em back home. We
      ought to be over a dozen strong by dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds good, all right,&rdquo; remarked Slivers, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but can we
      do it that easy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course we can! We ain't fools, an' we all can shoot as well as them,&rdquo;
       snapped Laramie Joe, the most courageous of the lot. Laramie had taken
      only one drink, and that a small one, for he was wise enough to realize
      that he needed his wits as keen as he could have them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do it easy, if Edwards goes under first,&rdquo; hastily replied Harlan.
      &ldquo;An' me an' Laramie will see to that part of it. If we don't get him, you
      all can hit the trail an' we won't be sore about it. That is, unless you
      are made of the stuff that stands up an' fights 'stead of running away. I
      reckon I ain't none mistaken in any of you. You'll all be there when
      things get hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can bet the shack <i>I</i> won't do no trail-hitting,&rdquo; growled
      Boston, glancing at Slivers, who squirmed a little under the hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glued to the crowd; you can't lose me, fellers,&rdquo; Slivers
      remarked, re-crossing his legs uneasily. &ldquo;Are we going to begin it from
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to spread out cautions and surround Jackson's, or wherever
      Edwards is,&rdquo; Laramie Joe suggested. &ldquo;That's my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're right! Now you've hit it plumb on the head!&rdquo; interrupted Harlan,
      slapping Laramie heartily across the back. &ldquo;What did I tell you about our
      brains?&rdquo; he cried, enthusiastically. He had been on the point of
      suggesting that plan of operations when Laramie took the words out of his
      mouth. &ldquo;I'd never thought of that, Laramie,&rdquo; he lied, his face beaming.
      &ldquo;Why, we've got 'em licked to a finish right now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This <i>is</i> a hummer of a game,&rdquo; laughed Slivers. &ldquo;But how about the
      Bar-20 crowd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've told you that already,&rdquo; replied the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it's a hummer,&rdquo; cried Boston, reaching for the whiskey bottle
      under cover of the excitement and enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan pushed it away with his foot and raised his clenched fist. &ldquo;Do you
      wonder I didn't think of that plan?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Ain't I been too mad to
      think at all? Hain't I seen my friends treated like dogs, an' made to
      swaller insults when I couldn't raise my hand to stop it? Didn't I see
      Jerry Brown chased out of my place like a wild beast? If we are what we've
      been called, then we'll sneak out of town with our tails atween our laigs;
      but if we're men we'll stay right here an' cram the insults down the
      throats of them that made 'em! If we're <i>men</i> let's prove it an' make
      them liars swaller our lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sentiments an' allus was!&rdquo; roared Slivers, slapping Harlan's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're men, all right, an' we'll show 'em it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the door opened and four guns covered it before it had
      swung a foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put 'em down&mdash;it's Quinn!&rdquo; exclaimed the man in the doorway,
      flinching a bit. &ldquo;All right, Jed,&rdquo; he called over his shoulder to the man
      who crowded him. After Quinn came Big Jed and Harper brought up the rear.
      They had no more than shaken the water from their sombreros when the back
      door let in Charley Rich and his two companions, Frank and Tom Nolan.
      While greetings were being exchanged and the existing conditions explained
      to the newcomers, Harper and Quinn led Harlan to one side and reported,
      the proprietor smiling and nodding his head wisely. And while he listened,
      Slivers surreptitiously corralled the whiskey bottle and when the last man
      finished with it there was nothing in it but air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; exclaimed Harlan, &ldquo;things are our way. Quinn, here, met Joe
      Barr, of the C-80, who said Converse an' four other fellers, all friends
      of Edwards, stopped at the ranch an' won't be back home till the storm
      stops. Harper saw Fred Neil going back to his ranch, so all we've got to
      figger on is the marshal, Barr, an' Jackson, an' they're all in Jackson's
      store. Lacey might cut in, since he'd sell more liquor if I went under,
      but he can't do very much if he does take a hand. Now we'll get right at
      it.&rdquo; The whole thing was gone over thoroughly and in detail, positions
      assigned and a signal agreed upon. Seeing that weapons were in good
      condition after their long storage in the cellar, and that cartridge belts
      were full, the ten men left the room one at a time or in pairs, Harlan and
      Laramie Joe being the last. And both Harlan and Laramie delayed long
      enough to take the precaution of placing horses where they would be handy
      in case of need.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HARLAN STRIKES
    </h3>
    <p>
      Joe Barr laughingly replied to Johnny Nelson's growled remarks about the
      condition of things in general and tried to soothe him, but Johnny was
      unsoothable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I've been telling him right along that he's got the best of it,&rdquo;
       complained Jackson in a weary voice. &ldquo;Got a measly hole through his
      shoulder&mdash;good Lord! if it had gone a little lower!&rdquo; he finished with
      a show of exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ain't I been telling you all along that it ain't the measly hole in
      my shoulder that's got me on the prod?&rdquo; retorted Johnny, with more
      earnestness than politeness. &ldquo;But why couldn't I go with my friends after
      Jerry an' get shot later if I had to get it at all? Look what I'm missing,
      roped an' throwed in this cussed ten-by-ten shack while they're having a
      little excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're missing some blamed nasty weather, Kid,&rdquo; replied the marshal. &ldquo;You
      ain't got no kick coming at all. Why, I got soaked clean through just
      going down to the Oasis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm kicking, just the same,&rdquo; snapped Johnny. &ldquo;An' furthermore, I
      don't see nobody big enough to stop me, neither&mdash;did you all get
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rear door opened and Fred Neal looked in. &ldquo;Hey, Barr; come out an'
      gimme a hand in the corral. Busted my cinch all to pieces half a mile out&mdash;an'
      how the devil it ever busted like that is&mdash;&rdquo; the door slammed shut
      and softened his monologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you listen to that!&rdquo; snorted Barr in an injured tone. &ldquo;Didn't I go
      an' tell him near a month ago that his cussed cinch wouldn't hold no
      better'n a piece of wet paper?&rdquo; His complaint added materially to the
      atmosphere of sullen discontent pervading the room. &ldquo;An' now I gotter go
      out in this rain an'&mdash;&rdquo; the slam of the door surpassed anything yet
      attempted in that line of endeavor. Jackson grabbed a can of corn as it
      jarred off the shelf behind him and directed a pleasing phrase after the
      peevish Barr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, won't somebody please smile?&rdquo; gravely asked Edwards. &ldquo;I never saw
      such a happy, cheerful bunch before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might smile if I wasn't so blamed hungry,&rdquo; retorted Johnny. &ldquo;Doesn't
      anybody ever eat in this town?&rdquo; he asked in great sarcasm. &ldquo;Mebby a good
      feed won't do me no good, but I'm going to fill myself regardless. An'
      after that, if the grub don't shock me to death, I'm shore going to trim
      somebody at Ol' Sledge&mdash;for two bits a hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could play you enough hands at that price I could sell out an' live
      high without working,&rdquo; grinned Jackson, preparing to give the reckless
      invalid all he could eat. &ldquo;That's purty high, Kid; but I just feel real
      devilish, an' I'm coming in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I'll go over to my shack, get some money, an' bust the pair of you,&rdquo;
       laughed Edwards, again buttoning his coat and going towards the door.
      &ldquo;Holy Cats! A log must 'a' got jammed in the sluice-gate up there,&rdquo; he
      muttered, scowling at the black sky. &ldquo;It's coming down harder'n ever, but
      here goes,&rdquo; and he stepped quickly into the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson paused with a frying pan in his hands and looked through the
      window after the departing marshal, and saw him stagger, stumble forward,
      then jerk out his guns and begin firing. Hard firing now burst out in
      front and Jackson, cursing angrily, dropped the pan and reached for his
      rifle&mdash;to drop it also and sink down, struck by the bullet which
      drilled through the window. Johnny let out a yell of rage, grabbed his
      Colt, and ran to the door in time to see Edwards slowly raise up on one
      elbow, fire his last shot, and fall back riddled by bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson crawled to his rifle and then to the side window, where he propped
      his back against a box and prepared to do his best. &ldquo;It was shore a
      surprise,&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;An' they went an' got Edwards before he could do
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not!&rdquo; retorted Johnny. &ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo; the glass in the door
      vibrated sharply and the speaker, stepping to one side out of sight, with
      a new and superficial wound, opened fire on the building down the street.
      Two men were lying on the ground across the street&mdash;these Edwards had
      shot&mdash;and another was trying to drag himself to the shelter of a
      building. A man sprinted from an old corral close by in a brave and
      foolhardy attempt to save his friend, and Johnny swore because he had to
      fire twice at the same mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rear door crashed open and shut as Barr, closely followed by Neal, ran
      in. They had been caught in the corral but, thanks to Harlan's whiskey,
      had managed to hold their own until they had a chance to make a rush for
      the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the marshal?&rdquo; cried Barr, catching sight of Jackson. &ldquo;Are you
      plugged bad?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't plugged a whole lot <i>good</i>!&rdquo; snapped Jackson. &ldquo;An'
      Edwards is dead. They shot him down without warning. We're going to get
      ours, too&mdash;these walls don't stop them bullets. How many out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be a dozen,&rdquo; hastily replied Neal, who had not remained idle. Both
      he and Barr were working like mad men moving boxes and barrels against the
      walls to make a breastwork capable of stopping the bullets which came
      through the boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon&mdash;I'm bleeding inside,&rdquo; Jackson muttered, wearily and
      without hope. &ldquo;Wonder how&mdash;long we&mdash;can hold out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll hold out till we're good an' dead!&rdquo; replied Johnny, hotly. &ldquo;They
      ain't got us yet an' they'll pay for it before they do. If we can hold 'em
      off till Buck an' the rest come back we'll have the pleasure of seeing 'em
      buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll get you next time!&rdquo; assured Barr to an enemy, slipping a fresh
      cartridge into the Sharps and peering intently at a slight rise on the
      muddy plain. &ldquo;You shoot like yo're drunk,&rdquo; he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it all about, anyhow?&rdquo; asked Neal, finding time for an
      immaterial question. &ldquo;Who are they?&mdash;can't see nothing but blurs
      through this rain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what's the game?&rdquo; asked Barr, mildly surprised that he had not
      thought of it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that Oasis gang,&rdquo; Johnny responded. He fired, and growled with
      disappointment. &ldquo;Harlan's at the head of it,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edwards&mdash;told Harlan to&mdash;get out of&mdash;town,&rdquo; Jackson began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' to take his gang with him,&rdquo; Johnny interposed quickly to save Jackson
      from the strain. &ldquo;They had till dark. Guess the rest. Oh, you <i>coyote</i>!&rdquo;
       he shouted, staggering back. There was a report farther down the barricade
      and Neal called out, &ldquo;I got him, Nelson; he's done. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad! Mad!&rdquo; yelled Johnny, touching his twice-wounded shoulder and dancing
      with rage and pain. &ldquo;Right in the same place! Oh, wait! <i>Wait!</i> Hey,
      gimme a rifle&mdash;I can't do nothing with a Colt at this range; my name
      ain't Hopalong,&rdquo; and he went slamming around the room in hot search of
      what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't&mdash;no more&mdash;Johnny,&rdquo; feebly called Jackson, raising
      slightly to ease himself. &ldquo;You can have&mdash;my gun purty&mdash;soon. I
      won't be able&mdash;to use it&mdash;much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't Buck an' Hoppy hurry up!&rdquo; snarled Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be a long time&mdash;mebby,&rdquo; mumbled Jackson, his trembling hands trying
      to steady the rifle. &ldquo;They're all&mdash;around us. <i>Ah</i>, missed!&rdquo; he
      intoned hoarsely, trying to pump the lever with unobeying hands. &ldquo;I can't
      last&mdash;much&mdash;&rdquo; the words ceased abruptly and the clatter of the
      rifle on the floor told the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny stumbled over to him and dragged him aside, covering the upturned
      face with his own sombrero, and picked up the rifle. Rolling a barrel of
      flour against the wall below the window he fixed himself as comfortably as
      possible and threw a shell into the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you coyotes; you pay <i>me</i> for <i>that</i>!&rdquo; he gritted, resting
      the gun on the window sill and holding it so he could work it with one
      hand and shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder how them pups ever pumped up enough courage to cut loose like
      this?&rdquo; queried Neal from behind his flour barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiskey,&rdquo; hazarded Barr. &ldquo;Harlan must 'a' got 'em drunk. An' that's three
      times I've missed that snake. Wish it would stop raining so I could see
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you wish they'd all drop dead? Wish good when you wish at all:
      got as much chance of having it come true,&rdquo; responded Neal, sarcastically.
      He smothered a curse and looked curiously at his left arm, and from it to
      the new, yellow-splintered hole in the wall, which was already turning
      dark from the water soaking into it. &ldquo;Hey, Joe; we need some more boxes!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, again looking at his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came Johnny's voice. &ldquo;Three of 'em&mdash;five of 'em, an' about six
      feet long an' a foot deep. But if my outfit gets here in time we'll want
      more'n a dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! Lacey's firing now!&rdquo; suddenly cried Barr. &ldquo;He's shooting out of his
      windy. That'll stop 'em from rushing us! Good boy, Lacey!&rdquo; he shouted, but
      Lacey did not hear him in the uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he's worse off than we are, being alone,&rdquo; commented Neal. &ldquo;Hey! One
      of us better make a break for help&mdash;my ranch's the nearest. What d'ye
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's suicide; they'll get you before you get ten feet,&rdquo; Barr replied with
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they won't&mdash;the corral hides the back door, an' all the firing
      is on this side. I can sneak along the back wall an' by keeping the
      buildings atween me an' them, get a long ways off before they know
      anything about it. Then it's a dash&mdash;an' they can't catch me. But can
      you fellers hold out if I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two can hold out as good as three&mdash;go ahead,&rdquo; Johnny replied. &ldquo;Leave
      me some of yore Colt cartridges, though. You can't use 'em all before you
      get home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stop fer that; there's a shelfful of all kinds behind the counter,&rdquo;
       Barr interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long an' good luck,&rdquo; and the rear door closed, and softly this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours is some wait under the present circumstances,&rdquo; Barr muttered,
      shifting his position behind his barricade. &ldquo;He can't do it in less,
      nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny ducked and looked foolish. &ldquo;Missed me by a foot,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He
      can't do it in two&mdash;not there an' back,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The trail is
      mud over the fetlocks. Give him three at the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't shooting as much as they was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting till they gets sober, I reckon,&rdquo; Johnny replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don't hear no ruction in a few minutes we'll know he got away all
      right,&rdquo; Barr soliloquized. &ldquo;An' he's got a fine cayuse for mud, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, why can't you do the same thing if he makes it?&rdquo; Johnny suddenly
      asked. &ldquo;I can hold her alone, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're a cheerful liar, you are,&rdquo; laughed Barr. &ldquo;But can <i>you</i> ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon so, but I ain't a-going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we <i>both</i> can go&mdash;it's a cinch!&rdquo; Barr cried. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&mdash;an' I never even thought of that! Reckon I was too mad,&rdquo;
       Johnny replied. &ldquo;But I sort of hates to leave Jackson an' Edwards,&rdquo; he
      added, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're gone! You can't do them no good by staying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know. An' how about Lacey chipping in on our fight?&rdquo; demanded
      Johnny. &ldquo;I ain't a-going to leave him to take it all. You go, Barr; it
      wasn't yore fight, nohow. You didn't even know what you was fighting for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! When anybody shoots at me it's my fight, all right,&rdquo; replied Barr,
      seating himself on the floor behind the breastwork. &ldquo;I forgot all about
      Lacey,&rdquo; he apologized. At that instant a tomato can went <i>spang!</i> and
      fell off the shelf. &ldquo;An' it's too late, anyhow; they ain't a-going to let
      nobody else get away on that side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' they're tuning up again, too,&rdquo; Johnny replied, preparing for trouble.
      &ldquo;Look out for a rush, Barr.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BAR-20 RETURNS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hopalong Cassidy stopped swearing at the weather and looked up and along
      the trail in front of him, seeing a hard-riding man approach. He turned
      his head and spoke to Buck Peters, who rode close behind him. &ldquo;Somebody's
      shore in a hurry&mdash;why, it's Fred Neal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was. Mr. Neal was making his arms move and was also shouting something
      at the top of his voice. The noise of the rain and of the horses' hoofs
      splashing in the mud and water at first made his words unintelligible, but
      it was not long before Hopalong heard something which made him sit up even
      straighter. In a moment Neal was near enough to be heard distinctly and
      the outfit shook itself out of its weariness and physical misery and
      followed its leader at reckless speed. As they rode, bunched close
      together, Neal briefly and graphically outlined the relative positions of
      the combatants, and while Buck's more cautious mind was debating the best
      way to proceed against the enemy, Hopalong cried out the plan to be
      followed. There would be no strategy&mdash;Johnny, wounded and desperate,
      was fighting for his life. The simplest way was the best&mdash;a dash
      regardless of consequences to those making it, for time was a big factor
      to the two men in Jackson's store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride right at 'em!&rdquo; Hopalong cried. &ldquo;I know that bunch. They'll be too
      scared to shoot straight. Paralyze 'em! Three or four are gone now&mdash;an'
      the whole crowd wasn't worth one of the men they went out to get. The
      quicker it's over the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; came from the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride up the arroyo as close as we can get, an' then over the edge an'
      straight at 'em,&rdquo; Buck ordered. &ldquo;Their shooting an' the rain will cover
      what noise we make on the soft ground. An' boys, <i>no quarter</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon <i>not</i>!&rdquo; gritted Red, savagely. &ldquo;Not with Edwards an' Jackson
      dead, an' the Kid fighting for his life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're still at it!&rdquo; cried Lanky Smith, as the faint and intermittent
      sound of firing was heard; the driving wind was blowing from the town, and
      this, also, would deaden the noise of their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord! That means that there's somebody left to fight 'em,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Red. &ldquo;Hope it's the Kid,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't rush the store till they get Lacey, an' they can't rush him
      till they get the store,&rdquo; shouted Neal over his shoulder. &ldquo;They'd be in a
      cross fire if they tried either&mdash;an' that's what licks 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll be in a cross fire purty soon,&rdquo; promised Pete, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong and Red reached the edge of the arroyo first and plunged over the
      bank into the yellow storm-water swirling along the bottom like a
      miniature flood. After them came Buck, Neal, and the others, the water
      shooting up in sheets as each successive horse plunged in. Out again on
      the farther side they strung out into single file along the narrow
      foot-hold between water and bank and raced towards the sharp bend some
      hundreds of yards ahead, the point in the arroyo's course nearest the
      town. The dripping horses scrambled up the slippery incline and then,
      under the goading of spurs and quirts, leaped forward as fast as they
      could go across the level, soggy plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of a mile ahead of them lay the scattered shacks of the town,
      and as they drew nearer to it the riders could see the flashes of guns and
      the smoke-fog lying close to the ground. Fire spat from Jackson's store
      and a cloud of smoke still lingered around a window in Lacey's saloon.
      Then a yell reached their ears, a yell of rage, consternation and warning.
      Figures scurried to seek cover and the firing from Jackson's and Lacey's
      grew more rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mounted man emerged from a corral and tore away, others following his
      example, and the outfit separated to take up the chase individually.
      Harlan, wounded hard, was trying to run to where he had left his horse,
      and after him fled Slivers Lowe. Hopalong was gaining on them when he saw
      Slivers raise his arm and fire deliberately into the back of the
      proprietor of the Oasis, leap over the falling body, vault into the saddle
      of Harlan's horse and gallop for safety. Hopalong's shots went wide and
      the last view any one had of Slivers in that part of the country was when
      he dropped into an arroyo to follow it for safety. Laramie Joe fled before
      Red Connors and Red's rage was so great that it spoiled his accuracy, and
      he had the sorrow of seeing the pursued grow faint in the mist and fog.
      Pursuit was tried until the pursuers realized that their mounts were too
      worn out to stand a show against the fresh animals ridden by the survivors
      of the Oasis crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red circled and joined Hopalong. &ldquo;Blasted coyotes,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Killed
      Jackson an' Edwards, an' wanted the Kid! He's shore showed 'em what
      fighting is, all right. But I wonder what got into 'em all at once to give
      'em nerve enough to start things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edwards paid his way, all right,&rdquo; replied Hopalong. &ldquo;If I do as well when
      my time comes I won't do no kicking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yore time ain't coming that way,&rdquo; responded Red, grinning. &ldquo;You'll die a
      natural death in bed, unless you gets to cussing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore there ain't no more, Buck?&rdquo; Hopalong called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There was only five, I reckon, an' they was purty well shot up when
      we took a hand. You know, Johnny was in it all the time,&rdquo; replied the
      foreman, smiling. &ldquo;This town's had the cleaning up it's needed for some
      time,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at Jackson's store now, and hurriedly dismounted and ran in to
      see Johnny. They found him lying across some boxes, which brought him
      almost to the level of a window sill. He was too weak to stand, while near
      him in similar condition lay Barr, too weak from loss of blood to do more
      than look his welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Kid?&rdquo; cried Buck anxiously, bending over him, while others
      looked to Barr's injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired, Buck, awful tired; an' all shot up,&rdquo; Johnny slowly replied. &ldquo;When
      I saw you fellers&mdash;streak past this windy&mdash;I sort of went flat&mdash;something
      seemed to break inside me,&rdquo; he said, faintly and with an effort, and the
      foreman ordered him not to talk. Deft fingers, schooled by practice in
      rough and ready surgery, were busy over him and in half an hour he lay on
      Jackson's cot, covered with bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hullo, Lacey!&rdquo; exclaimed Hopalong, leaping forward to shake hands
      with the man Red and Billy had gone to help. &ldquo;Purty well scratched up, but
      lively yet, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm able to hobble over here an' shake han's with these scrappers&mdash;they're
      shore wonders,&rdquo; Lacey replied. &ldquo;Fought like a whole regiment! Hullo,
      Johnny!&rdquo; and his hand-clasp told much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yore cross fire did it, Lacey; that was the whole thing,&rdquo; Johnny smiled.
      &ldquo;Yo're all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red turned and looked out of the window toward the Oasis and then glanced
      at Buck. &ldquo;Reckon we better burn Harlan's place&mdash;it's all that's left
      of that gang now,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I reckon so,&rdquo; replied the foreman. &ldquo;That's as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we won't!&rdquo; Hopalong interposed quickly. &ldquo;That stands till Johnny sets
      it off. It's the Kid's celebration&mdash;he was shot in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny smiled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BARB WIRE
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the flurry at Perry's Bend the Bar-20 settled down to the calm
      routine work and sent several drive herds to their destination without any
      unusual incidents. Buck thought that the last herd had been driven when,
      late in the summer, he received an order that he made haste to fill. The
      outfit was told to get busy and soon rounded up the necessary number of
      three-year-olds. Then came the road branding, the final step except
      inspection, and this was done not far from the ranch house, where the
      facilities were best for speedy work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entirely recovered from all ill effects of his afternoon in Jackson's
      store up in Perry's bend, Johnny Nelson waited with Red Connors on the
      platform of the branding chute and growled petulantly at the sun, the
      dust, but most of all at the choking, smarting odor of burned hair which
      filled their throats and caused them to rub the backs of grimy hands
      across their eyes. Chute-branding robbed them of the excitement, the
      leaven of fun and frolic, which they always took from open or corral
      branding&mdash;and the work of a day in the corral or open was condensed
      into an hour or two by the chute. This was one cow wide, narrow at the
      bottom and flared out as it went up, so the animal could not turn, and
      when filled was, to use Johnny's graphic phrase, &ldquo;like a chain of cows in
      a ditch.&rdquo; Eight of the wondering and crowded animals, guided into the pen
      by men who knew their work to the smallest detail and lost no time in its
      performance, filed into the pen after those branded had filed out. As the
      first to enter reached the farther end a stout bar dropped into place,
      just missing the animal's nose; and as the last cow discovered that it
      could go no farther and made up its mind to back out, it was stopped by
      another bar, which fell behind it. The iron heaters tossed a hot iron each
      to Red and Johnny and the eight were marked in short order, making about
      two hundred and fifty they had branded in three hours. This number
      compared very favorably with that of the second chute where Lanky Smith
      and Frenchy McAlister waved cold irons and sarcastically asked their iron
      men if the sun was supposed to provide the heat; whereat the down-trodden
      heaters provided heat with great generosity in their caustic retorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me,&rdquo; sang Billy Williams, one of the
      feeders. &ldquo;But why in Jericho don't you fellers get a move on you? You
      ain't no good on the platform&mdash;you ought to be mixing biscuits for
      Cookie. Frenchy and Lanky are the boys to turn 'em out,&rdquo; he offered,
      gratis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red's weary air bespoke a vast and settled contempt for such inanities and
      his iron descended against the side of the victim below him&mdash;he would
      not deign to reply. Not so with Johnny, who could not refrain from hot
      retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool <i>all</i> the time,&rdquo; snapped Johnny. &ldquo;Mind yore own
      business, you shorthorn. Big-mouthed old woman, that's what&mdash;&rdquo; his
      tone dropped and the words sank into vague mutterings which a strangling
      cough cut short. &ldquo;Blasted idiot,&rdquo; he whispered, tears coming into his eyes
      at the effort. Burning hair is bad for throat and temper alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red deftly knocked his companion's iron up and spoke sharply. &ldquo;You mind
      yourn better&mdash;that makes the third you've tried to brand twice. Why
      don't you look what yo're doing? Hot iron! Hot iron! What're you fellers
      doing?&rdquo; he shouted down at the heaters. &ldquo;This ain't no time to go to
      sleep. How d'ye expect us to do any work when you ain't doing any
      yoreselves!&rdquo; Red's temper was also on the ragged edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got one in yore other hand, you sheep!&rdquo; snorted one of the iron
      heaters with restless pugnacity. &ldquo;Go tearing into us when you&mdash;&rdquo; he
      growled the rest and kicked viciously at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely bunch,&rdquo; grinned Billy who, followed by Pete Wilson, mounted the
      platform to relieve the branders. &ldquo;Chase yoreselves&mdash;me an' Pete are
      shore going to show you cranky bugs how to do a hundred an hour. Ain't we,
      Pete? An' look here, you,&rdquo; he remarked to the heaters, &ldquo;don't you fellers
      keep <i>us</i> waiting for hot irons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right! Make a fool out of yoreself first thing!&rdquo; snapped one of
      the pair on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, I never loved you as much as I do this minute,&rdquo; grinned Johnny
      wearily. &ldquo;Wish you'd 'a' come along to show us how to do it an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit chinning an' get busy,&rdquo; remarked Red, climbing down. &ldquo;The chute's
      full; an' it's all yourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy caught the iron, gave it a preliminary flourish, and started to work
      with a speed that would not endure for long. He branded five out of the
      eight and jeered at his companion for being so slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have yore fun now, Billy,&rdquo; Pete replied with placid good nature. &ldquo;Before
      we're through with this job you'll be lucky if you can do two of the
      string, if you keep up that pace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be missing every other one,&rdquo; growled his heater with overflowing
      malice. &ldquo;That iron ain't cold, you Chinaman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too cold for me&mdash;don't miss none,&rdquo; chuckled Billy sweetly. &ldquo;Fill the
      chute! Fill the chute! Don't keep us waiting!&rdquo; he cried to the guiders,
      hopping around with feigned eagerness and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong Cassidy rode up and stopped as Red returned to take the place of
      one of the iron heaters. &ldquo;How they coming, Red?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fast. You can sic that inspector on 'em the first thing to-morrow
      morning, if he gets here on time. Bet he's off som'ers getting full of
      redeye. Who're going with you on this drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inspector is all right&mdash;he's here now an' is going to spend the
      night with us so as to be on hand the first thing to-morrow,&rdquo; replied
      Hopalong, grinning at the hard-working pair on the platform. &ldquo;Why, I
      reckon I'll take you, Johnny, Lanky, Billy, Pete, an' Skinny, an' we'll
      have two hoss-wranglers an' a cook, of course. We'll drive up the
      right-hand trail through West Valley this time. It's longer, but there'll
      be more water that way at this time of the year. Besides, I don't want no
      more foot-sore cattle to nurse along. Even the West Valley trail will be
      dry enough before we strike Bennett's Creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we'll have to drive 'em purty hard till we reach the creek,&rdquo; replied
      Red, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Say; we're going to have three thousand of the finest
      three-year-old steers ever sent north out of these parts. An' we ought to
      do it in a month an' deliver 'em fat an' frisky. We can feed 'em good for
      the last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just sent some of the boys out to drive in the cayuses,&rdquo; Hopalong
      remarked, &ldquo;an' when they get here you fellers match for choice an' pick
      yore remuda. No use taking too few. About eight apiece'll do us nice. I
      shore like a good cavvieyeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Hoppy!&rdquo; came from the platform as Billy grinned his welcome
      through the dust on his face. &ldquo;Want a job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo yoreself,&rdquo; growled Pete. &ldquo;Stick yore iron on that fourth steer
      before he gets out, an' talk less with yore mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete's still rabid,&rdquo; called Billy, performing the duty Pete suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be the polite name for it,&rdquo; snorted one of the iron heaters,
      testing an iron, &ldquo;but that ain't what I'd say. Might as well cover the
      subject thoroughly while yo're on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, verily,&rdquo; endorsed his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes the last of 'em,&rdquo; smiled Pete, watching several cattle being
      driven towards the chute. &ldquo;We'll have to brand 'em on the move, Billy;
      there ain't enough to fill the chute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; hot iron, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning the inspector looked them over and made his count,
      the herd was started north and at nightfall had covered twelve miles. For
      the next week everything went smoothly, but after that, water began to be
      scarce and the herd was pushed harder, and became harder to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the twelfth day out four men sat around the fire in West
      Valley at a point a dozen miles south of Bennett's Creek, and ate
      heartily. The night was black&mdash;not a star could be seen and the south
      wind hardly stirred the trampled and burned grass. They were thoroughly
      tired out and their tempers were not in the sweetest state imaginable, for
      the heat during the last four days had been almost unbearable even to them
      and they had had their hands full with the cranky herd. They ate silently,
      hungrily&mdash;there would be time enough for the few words they had to
      say when the pipes were going for a short smoke before turning in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like hell,&rdquo; growled Red, reaching for another cup of coffee, but
      there was no reply; he had voiced the feelings of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong listened intently and looked up, staring into the darkness, and
      soon a horseman was seen approaching the fire. Hopalong nodded welcome and
      waved his hand towards the food, and the stranger, dismounting, picketed
      his horse and joined the circle. When the pipes were lighted he sighed
      with satisfaction and looked around the group. &ldquo;Driving north, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' blamed glad to get off this dry range,&rdquo; Hopalong replied. &ldquo;The
      herd's getting cranky an' hard to hold&mdash;but when we pass the creek
      everything'll be all right again. An' ain't it hot! When you hear us kick
      about the heat it means something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going yore way,&rdquo; remarked the stranger. &ldquo;I came down this trail about
      two weeks ago. Reckon I was the last to ride through before the fence went
      up. Damned outrage, says I, an' I told 'em so, too. They couldn't see it
      that way an' we had a little disagreement about it. They said as how they
      was going to patrol it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fence! What fence?&rdquo; exclaimed Red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's there any fence?&rdquo; demanded Hopalong sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty mile north of the creek,&rdquo; replied the stranger, carefully packing
      his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Twenty miles north of the creek?&rdquo; cried Hopalong. &ldquo;What creek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bennett's. The 4X has strung three strands of barb wire from Coyote Pass
      to the North Arm. Thirty mile long, without a gate, so they says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it don't close this trail!&rdquo; cried Hopalong in blank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shore does. They say they owns that range an' can fence it in all they
      wants. I told 'em different, but naturally they didn't listen to me. An'
      they'll fight about it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they <i>can't</i> shut off this trail!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, with angry
      emphasis. &ldquo;They don't own it no more'n we do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about that&mdash;you heard me tell you what they said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can we get past it?&rdquo; demanded Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Around it, over the hills. You'll lose about three days doing it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't take no sand-range herd over them rocks, an' I ain't going to
      drive 'round no North Arm or Coyote Pass if I could,&rdquo; Hopalong replied
      with quiet emphasis. &ldquo;There's poison springs on the east an' nothing but
      rocks on the west. We go straight through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that you'll have to fight if you do,&rdquo; remarked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll fight!&rdquo; cried Johnny, leaning forward. &ldquo;Blasted coyotes! What
      right have they got to block a drive trail that's as old as cattle-raising
      in these parts! That trail was here before I was born, it's allus been
      open, an' it's going to stay open! You watch us go through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're dead right, Kid; we'll cut that fence an' stick to this trail, an'
      fight if we has to,&rdquo; endorsed Red. &ldquo;The Bar-20 ain't crawling out of no
      hole that it can walk out of. They're bluffing; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they are; an' there's twelve men in that outfit,&rdquo; suggested
      the stranger, offhand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't got time to count odds; we never do down our way when we know
      we're right. An' we're right enough in this game,&rdquo; retorted Hopalong,
      quickly. &ldquo;For the last twelve days we've had good luck, barring the few on
      this dry range; an' now we're in for the other kind. By the Lord, I wish
      we was here without the cows to take care of&mdash;we'd show 'em something
      about blocking drive trails that ain't in their little book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast it all! Wire fences coming down this way now,&rdquo; mused Johnny,
      sullenly. He hated them by training as much as he hated horse-thieves and
      sheep; and his companions had been brought up in the same school. Barb
      wire, the death-knell to the old-time punching, the bar to riding at will,
      a steel insult to fire the blood&mdash;it had come at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've shore got to cut it, Red,&mdash;&rdquo; began Hopalong, but the cook had
      to rid himself of some of his indignation and interrupted with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore we have!&rdquo; came explosively from the tail board of the chuck wagon.
      &ldquo;Got to lay it agin my li'l axe an' swat it with my big ol' monkey wrench!
      An' won't them posts save me a lot of trouble hunting chips an' firewood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've shore got to cut it, Red,&rdquo; Hopalong repeated slowly. &ldquo;You an'
      Johnny an' me'll ride ahead after we cross the creek to-morrow an' do it.
      I don't hanker after no fight with all these cows on my han's, but we've
      got to risk one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore!&rdquo; cried Johnny, hotly. &ldquo;I can't get over the gall of them fellers
      closing up the West Valley drive trail. Why, I never heard tell of such a
      thing afore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're short-handed; we ought to have more'n we have to guard the herd if
      there's a fight. If it stampedes&mdash;oh, well, that'll work out
      to-morrow. The creek's only about twelve miles away an' we'll start at
      daylight, so tumble in,&rdquo; Hopalong said as he arose. &ldquo;Red, I'm going out to
      take my shift&mdash;I'll send Pete in. Stranger,&rdquo; he added, turning, &ldquo;I'm
      much obliged to you for the warning. They might 'a' caught us with our
      hands tied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; hastily replied the stranger, who was in hearty
      accord with the plans, such as they were. &ldquo;My name's Hawkins, an' I don't
      like range fences no more'n you do. I used to hunt buffalo all over this
      part of the country before they was all killed off, an' I allus rode where
      I pleased. I'm purty old, but I can still see an' shoot; an' I'm going to
      stick right along with you fellers an' see it through. Every man counts in
      this game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's blamed white of you,&rdquo; Hopalong replied, greatly pleased by
      the other's offer. &ldquo;But I can't let you do it. I don't want to drag you
      into no trouble, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't dragging me none; I'm doing it myself. I'm about as mad as you
      are over it. I ain't good for much no more, an' if I shuffles off fighting
      barb wire I'll be doing my duty. First it was nesters, then railroads an'
      more nesters, then sheep, an' now it's wire&mdash;won't it never stop? By
      the Lord, it's got to stop, or this country will go to the devil an' won't
      be fit to live in. Besides, I've heard of your fellers before&mdash;I'll
      tie to the Bar-20 any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you must if you must; yo're welcome enough,&rdquo; laughed
      Hopalong, and he strode off to his picketed horse, leaving the others to
      discuss the fence, with the assistance of the cook, until Pete rode in.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FENCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Hopalong rode in at midnight to arouse the others and send them out
      to relieve Skinny and his two companions, the cattle were quieter than he
      had expected to leave them, and he could see no change of weather
      threatening. He was asleep when the others turned in, or he would have
      been further assured in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the plain where the herd was being held, Red and the three other
      guards had been optimistic until half of their shift was over and it was
      only then that they began to worry. The knowledge that running water was
      only twelve miles away had the opposite effect than the one expected, for
      instead of making them cheerful, it caused them to be beset with worry and
      fear. Water was all right, and they could not have got along without it
      for another day; but it was, in this case, filled with the possibility of
      grave danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny was thinking hard about it as he rode around the now restless herd,
      and then pulled up suddenly, peered into the darkness and went on again.
      &ldquo;Damn that disreputable li'l rounder! Why the devil can't he behave,
      'stead of stirring things up when they're ticklish?&rdquo; he muttered, but he
      had to grin despite himself. A lumbering form had blundered past him from
      the direction of the camp and was swallowed up by the night as it sought
      the herd, annoying and arousing the thirsty and irritable cattle along its
      trail, throwing challenges right and left and stirring up trouble as it
      passed. The fact that the challenges were bluffs made no difference to the
      pawing steers, for they were anxious to have things out with the rounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This frisky disturber of bovine peace was a yearling that had slipped into
      the herd before it left the ranch and had kept quiet and respectable and
      out of sight in the middle of the mass for the first few days and nights.
      But keeping quiet and respectable had been an awful strain, and his
      mischievous deviltry grew constantly harder to hold in check. Finally he
      could stand the repression no longer, and when he gave way to his
      accumulated energy it had the snap and ginger of a tightly stretched
      rubber band recoiling on itself. On the fourth night out he had thrown off
      his mask and announced his presence in his true light by butting a sleepy
      steer out of its bed, which bed he straightway proceeded to appropriate
      for himself. This was folly, for the ground was not cold and he had no
      excuse for stealing a body-warmed place to lie down; it was pure
      cussedness, and retribution followed hard upon the act. In about half a
      minute he had discovered the great difference between bullying poor,
      miserable, defenceless dogies and trying to bully a healthy, fully
      developed, and pugnacious steer. After assimilating the preliminary
      punishment of what promised to be the most thorough and workmanlike
      thrashing he had ever known, the indignant and frightened bummer wheeled
      and fled incontinently with the aroused steer in angry pursuit. The best
      way out was the most puzzling to the vengeful steer, so the bummer
      cavorted recklessly through the herd, turning and twisting and doubling,
      stepping on any steer that happened to be lying down in his path, butting
      others, and leavening things with great success. Under other conditions he
      would have relished the effect of his efforts, for the herd had arisen as
      one animal and seemed to be debating the advisability of stampeding; but
      he was in no mood to relish anything and thought only of getting away.
      Finally escaping from his pursuer, that had paused to fight with a
      belligerent brother, he rambled off into the darkness to figure it all out
      and to maintain a sullen and chastened demeanor for the rest of the night.
      This was the first time a brick had been under the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirits of youth recover quickly&mdash;his recovered so quickly
      that he was banished from the herd the very next night, which banishment,
      not being at all to his liking, was enforced only by rigid watchfulness
      and hard riding; and he was roundly cursed from dark to dawn by the
      worried men, most of whom disliked the bumming youngster less than they
      pretended. He was only a cub, a wild youth having his fling, and there was
      something irresistibly likable and comical in his awkward antics and
      eternal persistence, even though he was a pest. Johnny saw more in him
      than his companions could find, and had quite a little sport with him: he
      made fine practice for roping, for he was about as elusive as a
      grasshopper and uncertain as a flea. Johnny was in the same general class
      and he could sympathize with the irrepressible nuisance in its efforts to
      stir up a little life and excitement in so dull a crowd; Johnny hoped to
      be as successful in his mischievous deviltry when he reached the town at
      the end of the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night it was dark, and the bummer gained his coveted goal with
      ridiculous ease, after which he started right in to work off the high
      pressure of the energy he had accumulated during the last two nights. He
      had desisted in his efforts to gain the herd early in the evening and had
      rambled off and rested during the first part of the night, and the herders
      breathed softly lest they should stir him to renewed trials. But now he
      had succeeded, and although only Johnny had seen him lumber past, the
      other three guards were aware of it immediately by the results and swore
      in their throats, for the cattle were now on their feet, snorting and
      moving about restlessly, and the rattling of horns grew slowly louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't he having a devil of a good time!&rdquo; grinned Johnny. But it was not
      long before he realized the possibilities of the bummer's efforts and he
      lost his grin. &ldquo;If we get through the night without trouble I'll see that
      you are picketed if it takes me all day to get you,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Fun is
      fun, but it's getting a little too serious for comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometime after the middle of the second shift the herd, already irritable,
      nervous, and cranky because of the thirst they were enduring, and worked
      up to the fever pitch by the devilish manoeuvres of the exuberant and
      hard-working bummer, wanted only the flimsiest kind of an excuse to
      stampede, and they might go without an excuse. A flash of lightning, a
      crash of thunder, a wind-blown paper, a flapping wagon cover, the sudden
      and unheralded approach of a careless rider, the cracking and flare of a
      match, or the scent of a wolf or coyote&mdash;or water, would send an
      avalanche of three thousand crazed steers crashing its irresistible way
      over a pitch-black plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red had warned Pete and Billy, and now he rode to find Johnny and send him
      to camp for the others. As he got halfway around the circle he heard
      Johnny singing a mournful lay, and soon a black bulk loomed up in the dark
      ahead of him. &ldquo;That you, Kid?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That you, Johnny?&rdquo; he repeated,
      a little louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;We're going to have
      trouble aplenty to-night. Glad daylight ain't so very far off. That cussed
      li'l rake of a bummer got by me an' into the herd. He's shore raising Ned
      to-night, the li'l monkey: it's getting serious, Red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll shoot that yearling at daylight, damn him!&rdquo; retorted Red. &ldquo;I should
      'a' done it a week ago. He's picked the worst time for his cussed
      devilment! You ride right in an' get the boys, an' get 'em out here quick.
      The whole herd's on its toes waiting for the signal; an' the wink of an
      eye'll send 'em off. God only knows what'll happen between now and
      daylight! If the wind should change an' blow down from the north, they'll
      be off as shore as shooting. One whiff of Bennett's Creek is all that's
      needed, Kid; an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; interposed Johnny. &ldquo;There ain't no wind at all now. It's been
      quiet for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' that's one of the things that's worrying me. It means a change,
      shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always; we'll come out of this all right,&rdquo; assured Johnny, but he
      spoke without his usual confidence. &ldquo;There ain't no use&mdash;&rdquo; he paused
      as he felt the air stir, and he was conscious of Red's heavy breathing.
      There was a peculiar hush in the air that he did not like, a closeness
      that sent his heart up in his throat, and as he was about to continue a
      sudden gust snapped his neck-kerchief out straight. He felt that
      refreshing coolness which so often precedes a storm and as he weighed it
      in his mind a low rumble of thunder rolled in the north and sent a chill
      down his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Get the boys!&rdquo; cried Red, wheeling. &ldquo;It's <i>changed</i>! An'
      Pete an' Billy out there in front of&mdash;<i>there they go</i>!&rdquo; he
      shouted as a sudden tremor shook the earth and a roaring sound filled the
      air. He was instantly lost to ear and eye, swallowed by the oppressive
      darkness as he spurred and quirted into a great, choking cloud of dust
      which swept down from the north, unseen in the night. The deep thunder of
      hoofs and the faint and occasional flash of a six-shooter told him the
      direction, and he hurled his mount after the uproar with no thought of the
      death which lurked in every hole and rock and gully on the uneven and
      unseen plain beneath him. His mouth and nose were lined with dust, his
      throat choked with it, and he opened his burning eyes only at intervals,
      and then only to a slit, to catch a fleeting glance of&mdash;nothing. He
      realized vaguely that he was riding north, because the cattle would head
      for water, but that was all, save that he was animated by a desperate
      eagerness to gain the firing line, to join Pete and Billy, the two men who
      rode before that crazed mass of horns and hoofs and who were pleading and
      swearing and yelling in vain only a few feet ahead of annihilation&mdash;if
      they were still alive. A stumble, a moment's indecision, and the avalanche
      would roll over them as if they were straws and trample them flat beneath
      the pounding hoofs, a modern Juggernaut. If he, or they, managed to escape
      with life, it would make a good tale for the bunk house some night; if
      they were killed it was in doing their duty&mdash;it was all in a day's
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny shouted after him and then wheeled and raced towards the camp,
      emptying his Colt in the air as a warning. He saw figures scurrying across
      the lighted place, and before he had gained it his friends raced past him
      and gave him hard work catching up to them. And just behind him rode the
      stranger, to do what he could for his new friends, and as reckless of
      consequences as they.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed an age before they caught up to the stragglers, and when they
      realized how true they had ridden in the dark they believed that at last
      their luck was turning for the better, and pushed on with renewed hope.
      Hopalong shouted to those nearest him that Bennett's Creek could not be
      far away and hazarded the belief that the steers would slow up and stop
      when they found the water they craved; but his words were lost to all but
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the punchers were almost trapped and their escape made
      miraculous, for without warning the herd swerved and turned sharply to the
      right, crossing the path of the riders and forcing them to the east,
      showing Hopalong their silhouettes against the streak of pale gray low
      down in the eastern sky. When free from the sudden press of cattle they
      slowed perceptibly, and Hopalong did likewise to avoid running them down.
      At that instant the uproar took on a new note and increased threefold. He
      could hear the shock of impact, whip-like reports, the bellowing of cattle
      in pain, and he arose in his stirrups to peer ahead for the reason,
      seeing, as he did so, the silhouettes of his friends arise and then drop
      from his sight. Without additional warning his horse pitched forward and
      crashed to the earth, sending him over its head. Slight as was the warning
      it served to ease his fall, for instinct freed his feet from the stirrups,
      and when he struck the ground it was feet first, and although he fell flat
      at the next instant, the shock had been broken. Even as it was, he was
      partly stunned, and groped as he arose on his hands and knees. Arising
      painfully he took a short step forward, tripped and fell again; and felt a
      sharp pain shoot through his hand as it went first to break the fall.
      Perhaps it was ten seconds before he knew what it was that had thrown him,
      and when he learned that he also learned the reason for the whole calamity&mdash;in
      his torn and bleeding hand he held a piece of barb wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barb wire!&rdquo; he muttered, amazed. &ldquo;Barb wire! Why, what the&mdash;<i>Damn
      that ranch</i>!&rdquo; he shouted, sudden rage sweeping over him as the
      situation flashed through his mind and banished all the mental effects of
      the fall. &ldquo;They've gone an' strung it south of the creek as well! Red!
      Johnny! Lanky!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his voice, hoping to be heard
      over the groaning of injured cattle and the general confusion. &ldquo;Good Lord!
      <i>are they killed</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were not, thanks to the forced slowing up, and to the pool of water
      and mud which formed an arm of the creek, a back-water away from the pull
      of the current. They had pitched into the mud and water up to their
      waists, some head first, some feet first, and others as they would go into
      a chair. Those who had been fortunate enough to strike feet first pulled
      out the divers, and the others gained their feet as best they might and
      with varying degrees of haste, but all mixed profanity and thankfulness
      equally well; and were equally and effectually disguised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong, expecting the silence of death or at least the groaning of
      injured and dying, was taken aback by the fluent stream of profanity which
      greeted his ears. But all efforts in that line were eclipsed when the
      drive foreman tersely explained about the wire, and the providential mud
      bath was forgotten in the new idea. They forthwith clamored for war, and
      the sooner it came the better they would like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, boys; we've got work to do first,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, who,
      nevertheless, was troubled grievously by the same itching trigger finger.
      They subsided&mdash;as a steel spring subsides when held down by a weight&mdash;and
      went off in search of their mounts. Daylight had won the skirmish in the
      east and was now attacking in force, and revealed a sight which, stilling
      the profanity for the moment, caused it to flow again with renewed energy.
      The plain was a shambles near the creek, and dead and dying steers showed
      where the fence had stood. The rest of the herd had passed over these. The
      wounded cattle and three horses were put out of their misery as the first
      duty. The horse that Hopalong had ridden had a broken back; the other two,
      broken legs. When this work was out of the way the bruised and shaken men
      gave their attention to the scattered cattle on the other side of the
      creek, and when Hawkins rode up after wasting time in hunting for the
      trail in the dark, he saw four men with the herd, which was still
      scattered; four others near the creek, of whom only Johnny was mounted,
      and a group of six strangers riding towards them from the west and along
      the fence, or what was left of that portion of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's awful!&rdquo; he cried, stopping his limping horse near Hopalong. &ldquo;An'
      here come the fools that done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Johnny, his voice breaking from rage, &ldquo;but they won't go
      back again! I don't care if I'm killed if I can get one or two of that
      crowd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Kid!&rdquo; snapped Hopalong as the 4X outfit drew near. &ldquo;I know just
      how you feel about it; feel that way myself. But there ain't a-going to be
      no fighting while I've got these cows on my han's. That gang'll be here
      when we come back, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby one or two of 'em won't,&rdquo; remarked Hawkins, as he looked again over
      the carnage along the fence. &ldquo;I never did much pot-shooting, 'cept agin
      Injuns; but I dunno&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, for the strangers were
      almost at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranky Joe led the 4X contingent and he did the talking for it without
      waste of time. &ldquo;Who the hell busted that fence?&rdquo; he demanded,
      belligerently, looking around savagely. Johnny's hand twitched at the
      words and the way they were spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; did you think somebody leaned agin it?&rdquo; replied Hopalong, very
      calmly,&mdash;so calmly that it was about one step short of an explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why didn't you go around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand stampeding cattle don't go 'round wire fences in the
      dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's not our fault. Reckon you better dig down an' settle up for
      the damages, an' half a cent a head for water; an' then go 'round. You
      can't stampede through the other fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; asked Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're real shore it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well there's only six of us here, but there's six more that we can get
      blamed quick if we need 'em. It's so, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, coming down to figures, there's eight here, with two hoss-wranglers
      an' a cook to come,&rdquo; retorted Hopalong, kicking the belligerent Johnny on
      the shins. &ldquo;We're just about mad enough to tackle anything: ever feel that
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no use getting all het up,&rdquo; rejoined Cranky Joe. &ldquo;We ain't a-going to
      fight 'less we has to. Better pay up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send yore bills to the ranch&mdash;if they're O. K., Buck'll pay 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nix; I take it when I can get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got no money with me that I can spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can leave enough cows to buy back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to pay you one damned cent, an' the only cows I'll leave
      are the dead ones&mdash;an' if I could take them with me I'd do it. An'
      I'm not going around the fence, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; you are. An' yo're going to pay,&rdquo; snapped Cranky Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it out of the price of two hundred dead cows an' gimme what's left,&rdquo;
       Hopalong retorted. &ldquo;It'll cost you nine of them twelve men to pry it out'n
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't pay?&rdquo; demanded the other, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a plugged peso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I said before, I don't want to fight nobody 'less I has to,&rdquo;
       replied Cranky Joe. &ldquo;I'll give you a chance to change yore mind. We'll be
      out here after it to-morrow, cash or cows. That'll give you twenty-four
      hours to rest yore herd an' get ready to drive. Then you pay, an' go back,
      'round the fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; to-morrow suits me,&rdquo; responded Hopalong, who was boiling with
      rage and felt constrained to hold it back. If it wasn't for the cows&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Red and three companions swept up and stopped in a swirl of dust and asked
      questions until Hopalong shut them up. Their arrival and the manner of
      their speech riled Cranky Joe, who turned around and loosed one more
      remark; and he never knew how near to death he was at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellers must own the earth, the way you act,&rdquo; he said to Red and his
      three companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't fencing it in to prove it,&rdquo; rejoined Hopalong, his hand on Red's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranky Joe wheeled to rejoin his friends. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong and his men watched the six ride away, too enraged to speak for a
      moment. Then the drive foreman mastered himself and turned to Hawkins.
      &ldquo;Where's their ranch house?&rdquo; he demanded, sharply. &ldquo;There must be some way
      out of this, an' we've got to find it; an' before to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;West; three hours' ride along the fence. I could find 'em the darkest
      night what ever happened; I was out there once,&rdquo; Hawkins replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Describe 'em as exact as you can,&rdquo; demanded Hopalong, and when Hawkins
      had done so the Bar-20 drive foreman slapped his thigh and laughed
      nastily. &ldquo;One house with one door an' only two windows&mdash;are you
      shore? Good! Where's the corrals? Good again! So they'll take pay for
      their blasted fence, eh? Cash or cows, hey! Don't want no fight 'less it's
      necessary, but they're going to make us pay for the fence that killed two
      hundred head, an' blamed nigh got us, too. An' half a cent a head for
      drinking water! I've paid that more'n once&mdash;some of the poor devils
      squatting on the range ain't got nothing to sell but water, but I don't
      buy none out of Bennett's Creek! Pete, you mounted fellers round up a
      little&mdash;bunch the herd a little closer, an' drive straight along the
      trail towards that other fence. We'll all help you as soon as the
      wranglers bring us up something to ride. Push 'em hard, limp or no limp,
      till dark. They'll be too tired to go crow-hopping 'round any in the dark
      to-night. An' say! When you see that bummer, if he wasn't got by the
      fence, drop him clean. So they've got twelve men, hey! Huh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you going to do?&rdquo; asked Red, beginning to cool down, and very
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; tell us,&rdquo; urged Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm going to cut that fence, an' cut it all to hell. Then I'm going
      to push the herd through it as far out of danger as I can. When they're
      all right Cookie an' the hoss-wranglers will have to hold 'em during the
      night while we do the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the rest?&rdquo; demanded Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll tell you that later; it can wait,&rdquo; replied Hopalong. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
      you get out there with Pete an' help get the herd in shape. We'll be with
      you soon&mdash;here comes the wranglers an' the cavvieyeh. 'Bout time,
      too.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. BOGGS IS DISGUSTED
    </h3>
    <p>
      The herd gained twelve miles by dark and would pass through the northern
      fence by noon of the next day, for Cook's axe and monkey wrench had been
      put to good use. For quite a distance there was no fence: about a mile of
      barb wire had been pulled loose and was tangled up into several large
      piles, while rings of burned grass and ashes surrounded what was left of
      the posts. The cook had embraced this opportunity to lay in a good supply
      of firewood and was the happiest man in the outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock that night eight figures loped westward along the southern
      fence and three hours later dismounted near the first corral of the 4X
      ranch. They put their horses in a depression on the plain and then
      hastened to seek cover, being careful to make no noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn the door of the bunk house opened quickly and as quickly slammed
      shut again, three bullets in it being the reason. An uproar ensued and
      guns spat from the two windows in the general direction of the unseen
      besiegers, who did not bother about replying; they had given notification
      of their presence and until it was necessary to shoot there was no earthly
      use of wasting ammunition. Besides, the drive outfit had cooled down
      rapidly when it found that its herd was in no immediate danger and was not
      anxious to kill any one unless there was need. The situation was conducive
      to humor rather than anger. But every time the door moved it collected
      more lead, and it finally remained shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise in the bunk house continued and finally a sombrero was waved
      frantically at the south window and a moment later Nat Boggs, foreman of
      the incarcerated 4X outfit, stuck his head out very cautiously and yelled
      questions which bore directly on the situation and were to the point. He
      appeared to be excited and unduly heated, if one might judge from his
      words and voice. There was no reply, which still further added to his heat
      and excitement. Becoming bolder and a little angrier he allowed his
      impetuous nature to get the upper hand and forthwith attempted the feat of
      getting through that same window; but a sharp <i>pat!</i> sounded on a
      board not a foot from him, and he reconsidered hastily. His sombrero again
      waved to insist on a truce, and collected two holes, causing him much
      mental anguish and threatening the loss of his worthy soul. He danced up
      and down with great agility and no grace and made remarks, thereby leading
      a full-voiced chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't that a hell of a note?&rdquo; he demanded plaintively as he paused for
      breath. &ldquo;Stick <i>yore</i> hat out, Cranky, an' see what <i>you</i> can
      do,&rdquo; he suggested, irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cranky Joe regarded him with pity and reproach, and moved back towards the
      other end of the room, muttering softly to himself. &ldquo;I know it ain't much
      of a bonnet, but he needn't rub it in,&rdquo; he growled, peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try again; mebby they didn't see you,&rdquo; suggested Jim Larkin, who had a
      reputation for never making a joke. He escaped with his life and checked
      himself at the side of Cranky Joe, with whom he conferred on the harshness
      of the world towards unfortunates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the morning was spent in snipe-shooting at random, trusting to
      luck to hit some one, and trusting in vain. At noon Cranky Joe could stand
      the strain no longer and opened the door just a little to relive the
      monotony. He succeeded, being blessed with a smashed shoulder, and
      immediately became a general nuisance, adding greatly to the prevailing
      atmosphere. Boggs called him a few kinds of fools and hastened to nail the
      door shut; he hit his thumb and his heart became filled with venom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now</i> look at what they went an' done!&rdquo; he yelled, running around in
      a circle. &ldquo;Damned outrage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Cranky Joe with maddening superiority. &ldquo;That ain't nothing&mdash;just
      look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boggs looked, very fixedly, and showed signs of apoplexy, and Cranky Joe
      returned to his end of the room to resume his soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you come out an' take them cows!&rdquo; inquired an unkind voice from
      without. &ldquo;Ain't changed yore mind, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give you a drink for half a cent a head&mdash;that's the regular
      price for watering cows,&rdquo; called another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint ripple of mirth which ran around the plain was lost in opinions
      loudly expressed within the room; and Boggs, tears of rage in his eyes,
      flung himself down on a chair and invented new terms for describing human
      beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Terry was observing. He had been fluttering around the north window,
      constantly getting bolder, and had not been disturbed. When he withdrew
      his sombrero and found that it was intact he smiled to himself and leaned
      his elbows on the sill, looking carefully around the plain. The discovery
      that there was no cover on the north side cheered him greatly and he
      called to Boggs, outlining a plan of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boggs listened intently and then smiled for the first time since dawn.
      &ldquo;Bully for you, Terry!&rdquo; he enthused. &ldquo;Wait till dark&mdash;we'll fool
      'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bullet chipped the 'dobe at Terry's side and he ducked as he leaped
      back. &ldquo;From an angle&mdash;what did I tell you?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;We'll drop
      out here an' sneak behind the house after dark. They'll be watching the
      door&mdash;an' they won't be able to see us, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boggs sucked his thumb tenderly and grinned. &ldquo;After which&mdash;,&rdquo; he
      elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After which&mdash;,&rdquo; gravely repeated Terry, the others echoing it with
      unrestrained joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, mebby, I can get a drink,&rdquo; chuckled Larkin, brightening under the
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon comes up at ten,&rdquo; warned a voice. &ldquo;It'll be full to-night&mdash;an'
      there ain't many clouds in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ol' King Cole was a merry ol' soul</i>,&rdquo; hummed McQuade, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An'&mdash;a&mdash;merry&mdash;ol'&mdash;soul&mdash;was&mdash;he!&mdash;was&mdash;he!&rdquo;
       thundered the chorus, deep-toned and strong. &ldquo;<i>He had a wife for every
      toe, an' some toes counted three!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Meade, holding up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>An' every wife had sixteen dogs, an' every dog a flea!</i>&rdquo; shouted a
      voice from the besiegers, followed by a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hilarity continued until dark, only stopping when John Terry slipped
      out of the window, dropped to all-fours and stuck his head around the
      corner of the rear wall. He saw many stars and was silently handed to Pete
      Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; exclaimed Boggs in a low tone. &ldquo;Are you all right,
      Terry?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three knocks on the wall replied to his question and then McQuade went
      out, and three more knocks were heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder why they make that funny noise,&rdquo; muttered Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bumped inter something, I reckon,&rdquo; replied Jim Larkin. &ldquo;Get out of my way&mdash;I'm
      next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boggs listened intently and then pushed Duke Lane back. &ldquo;Don't like that&mdash;sounds
      like a crack on the head. Hey, Jim! <i>Say</i> something!&rdquo; he called
      softly. The three knocks were repeated, but Boggs was suspicious and he
      shook his head decisively. &ldquo;To 'ell with the knocking&mdash;<i>say</i>
      something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still got them twelve men?&rdquo; asked a strange voice, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>An' every dog a flea</i>,&rdquo; hummed another around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; shouted Boggs. &ldquo;To the door, fellers! To the door&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A whistle shrilled from behind the house and a leaden tattoo began on the
      door. &ldquo;Other window!&rdquo; whispered O'Neill. The foreman got there before him
      and, shoving his Colt out first to clear the way, yelled with rage and
      pain as a pole hit his wrist and knocked the weapon out of his hand. He
      was still commenting when Duke Lane pried open the door and, dropping
      quickly on his stomach, wriggled out, followed closely by Charley Beal and
      Tim. At that instant the tattoo drummed with greater vigor and such a hail
      of lead poured in through the opening that the door was promptly closed,
      leaving the three men outside to shift for themselves with the darkness
      their only cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke and his companions whispered together as they lay flat and agreed
      upon a plan of action. Going around the ends of the house was suicide and
      no better than waiting for the rising moon to show them to the enemy; but
      there was no reason why the roof could not be utilized. Tim and Charley
      boosted Duke up, then Tim followed, and the pair on the roof pulled
      Charley to their side. Flat roofs were great institutions they decided as
      they crawled cautiously towards the other side. This roof was of hard,
      sun-baked adobe, over two feet thick, and they did not care if their
      friends shot up on a gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine place, all right,&rdquo; thought Charley, grinning broadly. Then he turned
      an agonized face to Tim, his chest rising. &ldquo;<i>Hitch! Hitch!</i>&rdquo; he
      choked, fighting with all his will to master it. &ldquo;<i>Hitch-chew!
      Hitch-chew! Hitch-chew!</i>&rdquo; he sneezed, loudly. There was a scramble
      below and a ripple of mirth floated up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hitch-chew</i>?&rdquo; jeered a voice. &ldquo;What do we want to hit you for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look us over, children,&rdquo; invited another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until the moon comes up,&rdquo; chuckled the third. &ldquo;Be like knocking the
      nigger baby down for Red an' the others. Ladies and gents: We'll now have
      a little sketch entitled 'Shooting snipe by moonlight.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack-snipe, too,&rdquo; laughed Pete. &ldquo;Will somebody please hold the bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence on the roof was profound and the three on the ground tried
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me call yore attention to the trained coyotes, ladies an' gents,&rdquo;
       remarked Johnny in a deep, solemn voice. &ldquo;Coyotes are not birds; they do
      not roost on roofs as a general thing; but they are some intelligent an'
      can be trained to do lots of foolish tricks. These ani-mules were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step this way, people; on-ly ten cents, two nickels,&rdquo; interrupted Pete.
      &ldquo;They bark like dogs, an' howl like hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; snapped Tim, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the moon comes up,&rdquo; said Hopalong, &ldquo;when you fellers get tired
      dodging, you can chuck us yore guns an' come down. An' don't forget that
      this side of the house is much the safest,&rdquo; he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; snarled Duke, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't; they're laying for me down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny crawled to the north end of the wall and, looking cautiously around
      the corner, funnelled his hands: &ldquo;On the roof, Red! On the roof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; was the reply, followed by gun-shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! Move over!&rdquo; snapped Tim, working towards the edge furthest from the
      cheerful Red, whose bullets were not as accurate in the dark as they
      promised to become in a few minutes when the moon should come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to shove me off?&rdquo; snarled Charley, angrily. &ldquo;For heaven's sake,
      Duke, do you want the whole earth?&rdquo; he demanded of his second companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just bet yore shirt I do! An' I want a hole in it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you got no sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I be up here if I had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be hot as blazes up here when the sun gets high,&rdquo;
       cheerfully prophesied Tim: &ldquo;an' dry, too,&rdquo; he added for a finishing touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be lucky if we're live enough to worry about the sun's heat&mdash;<i>say</i>,
      that was a <i>close</i> one!&rdquo; exclaimed Duke, frantically trying to
      flatten a little more. &ldquo;Ah, thought so&mdash;there's that blamed moon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I'd gone out the window instead,&rdquo; growled Charley, worming behind
      Duke, to the latter's prompt displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellers better come down, one at a time,&rdquo; came from below. &ldquo;Send yore
      guns down first, too. Red's a blamed good shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope he croaks,&rdquo; muttered Duke. &ldquo;<i>That's</i> closer yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim's hand raised and a flash of fire singed Charley's hair. &ldquo;Got to do
      something, anyhow,&rdquo; he explained, lowering the Colt and peering across the
      plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned near succeeded!&rdquo; shouted Charley, grabbing at his head. &ldquo;Why,
      they're three hundred, an' you trying for 'em with a&mdash;<i>oh!</i>&rdquo; he
      moaned, writhing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locoed fool!&rdquo; swore Duke, &ldquo;showing 'em where we are! They're doing good
      enough as it is! You ought&mdash;got <i>you</i>, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I'm</i> going down&mdash;that blamed fool out there ain't caring what
      he hits,&rdquo; mumbled Charley, clenching his hands from pain. He slid over the
      edge and Pete grabbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; suggested Pete, expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim tossed his Colt over the edge. &ldquo;Here's another,&rdquo; he swore, following
      the weapon. He was grabbed and bound in a trice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When may we expect you, Mr. Duke?&rdquo; asked Johnny, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, friend, presently. I want to&mdash;<i>wow</i>!&rdquo; he finished,
      and lost no time in his descent, which was meteoric. &ldquo;That feller'll <i>kill</i>
      somebody if he ain't careful!&rdquo; he complained as Pete tied his hands behind
      his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait till daylight an' see,&rdquo; cheerily replied Pete as the three were
      led off to join their friends in the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no further action until the sun arose and then Hopalong hailed
      the house and demanded a parley, and soon he and Boggs met midway between
      the shack and the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you want?&rdquo; asked Boggs, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want you to stop this farce so I can go on with my drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't holding you!&rdquo; exploded the 4X foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; but you are. I can't let you an' yore men out to hang on our
      flanks an' worry us; an' I don't want to hold you in that shack till you
      all die of thirst, or come out to be all shot up. Besides, I can't fool
      around here for a week; I got business to look after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry about us dying with thirst; that ain't worrying us none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard different,&rdquo; replied Hopalong, smiling. &ldquo;Them fellers in the
      corral drank a quart apiece. See here, Boggs; you can't win, an' you know
      it. Yo're not bucking me, but the whole range, the whole country. It's a
      fight between conditions&mdash;the fence idea agin the open range idea,
      an' open trails. The fence will lose. You closed a drive trail that's
      'most as old as cow-raising. Will the punchers of this part of the country
      stand for it? Suppose you lick us,&mdash;which you won't&mdash;can you
      lick all the rest of us, the JD, Wallace's, Double-Arrow, C-80,
      Cross-O-Cross, an' the others! That's just what it amounts to, an' you
      better stop right now, before somebody gets killed. You know what that
      means in this section. Yo're six to our eight, you ain't got a drink in
      that shack, an' you dasn't try to get one. You can't do a thing agin us,
      an' you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boggs rested his hands on his hips and considered, Hopalong waiting for
      him to reply. He knew that the Bar-20 man was right but he hated to admit
      it, he hated to say he was whipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are any of them six hurt?&rdquo; he finally asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only scratches an' sore heads,&rdquo; responded Hopalong, smiling. &ldquo;We ain't
      tried to kill anybody, yet. I'm putting that up to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boggs made no reply and Hopalong continued: &ldquo;I got six of yore twelve men
      prisoners, an' all yore cayuses are in my han's. I'll shoot every animal
      before I'll leave 'em for you to use against me, an' I'll take enough of
      yore cows to make up for what I lost by that fence. You've got to pay for
      them dead cows, anyhow. If I do let you out you'll have to road-brand me
      two hundred, or pay cash. My herd ain't worrying me&mdash;it's moving all
      the time. It's through that other fence by now. An' if I have to keep my
      outfit here to pen you in or shoot you off I can send to the JD for a gang
      to push the herd. Don't make no mistake: yo're getting off easy. Suppose
      one of my men had been killed at the fence&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop this foolishness an' take down them fences for a mile each side of
      the trail. If Buck has to come up here the whole thing'll go down.
      Road-brand me two hundred of yore three-year-olds. Now as soon as you
      agree, an' say that the fight's over, it will be. You can't win out; an'
      what's the use of having yore men killed off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to quit,&rdquo; replied the other, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how that is; but yo're wrong on this question, dead wrong. You
      don't own this range or the trail. You ain't got no right to close that
      old drive trail. Honest, now; have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say them six ain't hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more'n I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' if I give in will you treat my men right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as soon as I get them two hundred three-year-olds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hate a quitter; but I can't do nothing, nohow,&rdquo; mused the 4X
      foreman. He cleared his throat and turned to look at the house. &ldquo;All
      right; when you get them cows you get out of here, an' don't never come
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong flung his arm with a shout to his men and the other kicked
      savagely at an inoffensive stick and slouched back to his bunk house, a
      beaten man.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TEX EWALT HUNTS TROUBLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not more than a few weeks after the Bar-20 drive outfit returned to the
      ranch a solitary horseman pushed on towards the trail they had followed,
      bound for Buckskin and the Bar-20 range. His name was Tex Ewalt and he
      cordially hated all of the Bar-20 outfit and Hopalong in particular. He
      had nursed a grudge for several years and now, as he rode south to rid
      himself of it and to pay a long-standing debt, it grew stronger until he
      thrilled with anticipation and the sauce of danger. This grudge had been
      acquired when he and Slim Travennes had enjoyed a duel with Hopalong
      Cassidy up in Santa Fe, and had been worsted; it had increased when he
      learned of Slim's death at Cactus Springs at the hands of Hopalong; and,
      some time later, hearing that two friends of his, &ldquo;Slippery&rdquo; Trendley and
      &ldquo;Deacon&rdquo; Rankin, with their gang, had &ldquo;gone out&rdquo; in the Panhandle with the
      same man and his friends responsible for it, Tex hastened to Muddy Wells
      to even the score and clean his slate. Even now his face burned when he
      remembered his experiences on that never-to-be-forgotten occasion. He had
      been played with, ridiculed, and shamed, until he fled from the town as a
      place accursed, hating everything and everybody. It galled him to think
      that he had allowed Buck Peters' momentary sympathy to turn him from his
      purpose, even though he was convinced that the foreman's action had saved
      his life. And now Tex was returning, not to Muddy Wells, but to the range
      where the Bar-20 outfit held sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several years of clean living had improved Tex, morally and physically.
      The liquor he had once been in the habit of consuming had been reduced to
      a negligible quantity; he spent the money on cartridges instead, and his
      pistol work showed the results of careful and dogged practice,
      particularly in the quickness of the draw. Punching cows on a remote
      northern range had repaid him in health far more than his old game of
      living on his wits and other people's lack of them, as proved by his clear
      eye and the pink showing through the tan above his beard; while his
      somber, steady gaze, due to long-held fixity of purpose, indicated the
      resourcefulness of a perfectly reliable set of nerves. His low-hung
      holster tied securely to his trousers leg to assure smoothness in drawing,
      the restrained swing of his right hand, never far from the well-worn
      scabbard which sheathed a triggerless Colt's &ldquo;Frontier&rdquo;&mdash;these showed
      the confident and ready gun-man, the man who seldom missed. &ldquo;Frontiers&rdquo;
       left the factory with triggers attached, but the absence of that part did
      not always incapacitate a weapon. Some men found that the regular method
      was too slow, and painstakingly cultivated the art of thumbing the hammer.
      &ldquo;Thumbing&rdquo; was believed to save the split second so valuable to a man in
      argument with his peers. Tex was riding with the set purpose of picking a
      fair fight with the best six-shooter expert it had ever been his
      misfortune to meet, and he needed that split second. He knew that he
      needed it and the knowledge thrilled him with a peculiar elation; he had
      changed greatly in the past year and now he wanted an &ldquo;even break&rdquo; where
      once he would have called all his wits into play to avoid it. He had found
      himself and now he acknowledged no superior in anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way south he met and talked with men who had known him, the old
      Tex, in the days when he had made his living precariously. They did not
      recognize him behind his beard, and he was content to let the oversight
      pass. But from these few he learned what he wished to know, and he was
      glad that Hopalong Cassidy was where he had always been, and that his
      gun-work had improved rather than depreciated with the passing of time. He
      wished to prove himself master of The Master, and to be hailed as such by
      those who had jeered and laughed at his ignominy several years before. So
      he rode on day after day, smiling and content, neither under-rating nor
      over-rating his enemy's ability with one weapon, but trying to think of
      him as he really was. He knew that if there was any difference between
      Hopalong Cassidy and himself that it must be very slight&mdash;perhaps so
      slight as to result fatally to both; but if that were so then it would
      have to work out as it saw fit&mdash;he at least would have accomplished
      what many, many others had failed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little town of Buckskin, known hardly more than locally, and never
      thought of by outsiders except as the place where the Bar-20 spent their
      spare time and money, and neutral ground for the surrounding ranches, was
      Cowan's saloon, in the dozen years of its existence the scene of good
      stories, boisterous fun, and quick deaths. Put together roughly, of crude
      materials, sticking up in inartistic prominence on the dusty edge of a
      dustier street; warped, bleached by the sun, and patched with boards
      ripped from packing cases and with the flattened sides of tin cans; low of
      ceiling, the floor one huge brown discoloration of spring, creaking
      boards, knotted and split and worn into hollows, the unpretentious
      building offered its hospitality to all who might be tempted by the
      scrawled, sprawled lettering of its sign. The walls were smoke-blackened,
      pitted with numerous small and clear-cut holes, and decorated with
      initials carelessly cut by men who had come and gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Cowan's, the best patronized place in many hot and dusty miles
      and the Mecca of the cowboys from the surrounding ranches. Often at night
      these riders of the range gathered in the humble building and told tales
      of exceeding interest; and on these occasions one might see a row of
      ponies standing before the building, heads down and quiet. It is strange
      how alike cow-ponies look in the dim light of the stars. On the south side
      of the saloon, weak, yellow lamp light filtered through the dirt on the
      window panes and fell in distorted patches on the plain, blotched in
      places by the shadows of the wooden substitutes for glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moonlight night late in the fall, after the last beef round-up
      was over and the last drive outfit home again, that two cow-ponies stood
      in front of Cowan's while their owners lolled against the bar and talked
      over the latest sensation&mdash;the fencing in of the West Valley range,
      and the way Hopalong Cassidy and his trail outfit had opened up the old
      drive trail across it. The news was a month old, but it was the last event
      of any importance and was still good to laugh over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; remarked the proprietor, &ldquo;I want you to meet Mr. Elkins. He came
      down that trail last week, an' he didn't see no fence across it.&rdquo; The man
      at the table arose slowly. &ldquo;Mr. Elkins, this is Sandy Lucas, an' Wood
      Wright, of the C-80. Mr. Elkins here has been a-looking over the country,
      sizing up what the beef prospects will be for next year; an' he knows all
      about wire fences. Here's how,&rdquo; he smiled, treating on the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elkins touched the glass to his bearded lips and set it down untasted
      while he joked over the sharp rebuff so lately administered to wire fences
      in that part of the country. While he was an ex-cow-puncher he believed
      that he was above allowing prejudice to sway his judgment, and it was his
      opinion, after careful thought, that barb wire was harmful to the best
      interests of the range. He had ridden over a great part of the cattle
      country in the last few yeas, and after reviewing the existing conditions
      as he understood them, his verdict must go as stated, and emphatically. He
      launched gracefully into a slowly delivered and lengthy discourse upon the
      subject, which proved to be so entertaining that his companions were
      content to listen and nod with comprehension. They had never met any one
      who was so well qualified to discuss the pros and cons of the barb-wire
      fence question, and they learned many things which they had never heard
      before. This was very gratifying to Mr. Elkins, who drew largely upon
      hearsay, his own vivid imagination, and a healthy logic. He was very glad
      to talk to men who had the welfare of the range at heart, and he hoped
      soon to meet the man who had taken the initiative in giving barb wire its
      first serious setback on that rich and magnificent southern range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shore ought to meet Cassidy&mdash;he's a fine man,&rdquo; remarked Lucas
      with enthusiasm. &ldquo;You'll not find any better, no matter where you look.
      But you ain't touched yore liquor,&rdquo; he finished with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Mr. Elkins, smiling
      deprecatingly. &ldquo;When a man likes it as much as I do it ain't very easy to
      foller instructions an' let it alone. Sometimes I almost break loose an'
      indulge, regardless of whether it kills me or not. I reckon it'll get me
      yet.&rdquo; He struck the bar a resounding blow with his clenched hand. &ldquo;But I
      ain't going to cave in till I has to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's purty tough,&rdquo; sympathized Wood Wright, reflectively. &ldquo;I ain't so
      very much taken with it, but I know I would be if I knowed I couldn't have
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's human nature, all right,&rdquo; laughed Lucas. &ldquo;That reminds me of
      a little thing that happened to me once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Cowan, holding up his hand for silence. &ldquo;I reckon
      that's the Bar-20 now, or some of it&mdash;sounds like them when they're
      feeling frisky. There's allus something happening when them fellers are
      around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor was right, as proved a moment later when Johnny Nelson,
      continuing his argument, pushed open the door and entered the room. &ldquo;I
      didn't neither; an' you know it!&rdquo; he flung over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo; demanded Hopalong, chuckling. &ldquo;Why, hullo, boys,&rdquo; he said,
      nodding to his friends at the bar. &ldquo;Nobody else would do a fool thing like
      that; nobody but you, Kid,&rdquo; he added, turning to Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care a hang what you think; I say I didn't an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shore did, all right; I seen him just afterward,&rdquo; laughed Billy
      Williams, pressing close upon Hopalong's heels. &ldquo;Howdy, Lucas; an' there's
      that ol' coyote, Wood Wright. How's everybody feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the rest of you fellers?&rdquo; inquired Cowan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stayed home to-night,&rdquo; replied Hopalong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any loose money, you two?&rdquo; asked Billy, grinning at Lucas and Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we have&mdash;an' our credit's good if we ain't. We're good for
      a dollar or two, ain't we, Cowan?&rdquo; replied Lucas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two dollars an' four bits,&rdquo; corrected Cowan. &ldquo;I'll raise it to three
      dollars even when you pay me that 'leven cents you owe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Leven cents? What 'leven cents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postage stamps an' envelope for that love letter you writ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to blazes; that wasn't no love letter!&rdquo; snorted Lucas, indignantly.
      &ldquo;That was my quarterly report. I never did write no love letters, nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll trim you fellers to-night, if you've got the nerve to play us,&rdquo;
       grinned Johnny, expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' we've got that, too. Give us the cards, Cowan,&rdquo; requested Wood
      Wright, turning. &ldquo;They won't give us no peace till we take all their money
      away from 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open game,&rdquo; prompted Cowan, glancing meaningly at Elkins, who stood by
      idly looking on, and without showing much interest in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore! Everybody can come in what wants to,&rdquo; replied Lucas, heartily,
      leading the others to the table. &ldquo;I allus did like a six-handed game best&mdash;all
      the cards are out an' there's some excitement in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the deal began Elkins was seated across the table from Hopalong,
      facing him for the first time since that day over in Muddy Wells, and
      studying him closely. He found no changes, for the few years had left no
      trace of their passing on the Bar-20 puncher. The sensation of facing the
      man he had come south expressly to kill did not interfere with Elkins'
      card-playing ability for he played a good game; and as if the Fates were
      with him it was Hopalong's night off as far as poker was concerned, for
      his customary good luck was not in evidence. That instinctive feeling
      which singles out two duellists in a card game was soon experienced by the
      others, who were careful, as became good players, to avoid being caught
      between them; in consequence, when the game broke up, Elkins had most of
      Hopalong's money. At one period of his life Elkins had lived on poker for
      five years, and lived well. But he gained more than money in this game,
      for he had made friends with the players and placed the first wire of his
      trap. Of those in the room Hopalong alone treated him with reserve, and
      this was cleverly swung so that it appeared to be caused by a temporary
      grouch due to the sting of defeat. As the Bar-20 man was known to be given
      to moods at times this was accepted as the true explanation and gave
      promise of hotly contested games for revenge later on. The banter which
      the defeated puncher had to endure stirred him and strengthened the
      reserve, although he was careful not to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last man rode off, Elkins and the proprietor sought their bunks
      without delay, the former to lie awake a long time, thinking deeply. He
      was vexed at himself for failing to work out an acceptable plan of action,
      one that would show him to be in the right. He would gain nothing more
      than glory, and pay too dearly for it, if he killed Hopalong and was in
      turn killed by the dead man's friends&mdash;and he believed that he had
      become acquainted with the quality of the friendship which bound the units
      of the Bar-20 outfit into a smooth, firm whole. They were like brothers,
      like one man. Cassidy must do the forcing as far as appearances went, and
      be clearly in the wrong before the matter could be settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next week was a busy one for Elkins, every day finding him in the
      saddle and riding over some one of the surrounding ranches with one or
      more of its punchers for company. In this way he became acquainted with
      the men who might be called on to act as his jury when the showdown came,
      and he proceeded to make friends of them in a manner that promised
      success. And some of his suggestions for the improvement of certain
      conditions on the range, while they might not work out right in the long
      run, compelled thought and showed his interest. His remarks on the
      condition and numbers of cattle were the same in substance in all cases
      and showed that he knew what he was talking about, for the punchers were
      all very optimistic about the next year's showing in cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fellers don't break all records for drive herds of quality next
      year I don't know nothing about cows; an' I shore don't know nothing
      else,&rdquo; he told the foreman of the Bar-20, as they rode homeward after an
      inspection of that ranch. &ldquo;There'll be more dust hanging over the drive
      trails leading from this section next year when spring drops the barriers
      than ever before. You needn't fear for the market, neither&mdash;prices
      will stand. The north an' central ranges ain't doing what they ought to
      this year&mdash;it'll be up to you fellers down south, here, to make that
      up; an' you can do it.&rdquo; This was not a guess, but the result of thought
      and study based on the observations he had made on his ride south, and
      from what he had learned from others along the way. It paralleled Buck's
      own private opinion, especially in regard to the southern range; and the
      vague suspicions in the foreman's mind disappeared for good and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say Elkins was a welcome visitor at the ranch houses and was
      regarded as a good fellow. At the Bar-20 he found only two men who would
      not thaw to him, and he was possessed of too much tact to try any
      persuasive measures. One was Hopalong, whose original cold reserve seemed
      to be growing steadily, the Bar-20 puncher finding in Elkins a personality
      that charged the atmosphere with hostility and quietly rubbed him the
      wrong way. Whenever he was in the presence of the newcomer he felt the
      tugging of an irritating and insistent antagonism and he did not always
      fully conceal it. John Bartlett, Lucas, and one or two of the more
      observing had noticed it and they began to prophesy future trouble between
      the two. The other man who disliked Elkins was Red Connors; but what was
      more natural? Red, being Hopalong's closest companion, would be very apt
      to share his friend's antipathy. On the other hand, as if to prove
      Hopalong's dislike to be unwarranted, Johnny Nelson swung far to the other
      extreme and was frankly enthusiastic in his liking for the cattle scout.
      And Johnny did not pour oil on the waters when he laughingly twitted
      Hopalong for allowing &ldquo;a licking at cards to make him sore.&rdquo; This was the
      idea that Elkins was quietly striving to have generally accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair thus hung fire, Elkins chafing at the delay and cautiously
      working for an opening, which at last presented itself, to be promptly
      seized. By a sort of mutual, unspoken agreement, the men in Cowan's that
      night passed up the cards and sat swapping stories. Cowan, swearing at a
      smoking lamp, looked up with a grin and burned his fingers as a roar of
      laughter marked the point of a droll reminiscence told by Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good story, Bartlett,&rdquo; Elkins remarked, slowing refilling his
      pipe. &ldquo;Reminds me of the lame Greaser, Hippy Joe, an' the canned oysters.
      They was both bad, an' neither of 'em knew it till they came together. It
      was like this. . . .&rdquo; The malicious side glance went unseen by all but
      Hopalong, who stiffened with the raging suspicion of being twitted on his
      own deformity. The humor of the tale failed to appeal to him, and when his
      full senses returned Lucas was in the midst of the story of the deadly
      game of tag played in a ten-acre lot of dense underbrush by two of his
      old-time friends. It was a tale of gripping interest and his auditors were
      leaning forward in their eagerness not to miss a word. &ldquo;An' Pierce won,&rdquo;
       finished Lucas; &ldquo;some shot up, but able to get about. He was all right in
      a couple of weeks. But he was bound to win; he could shoot all around Sam
      Hopkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the best shot won't allus win in that game,&rdquo; commented Elkins.
      &ldquo;That's one of the minor factors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! It's <i>luck</i> that counts there,&rdquo; endorsed Bartlett,
      quickly. &ldquo;Luck, nine times out of ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best shot ought to win,&rdquo; declared Skinny Thompson. &ldquo;It ain't all luck,
      nohow. Where'd I be against Hoppy, there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't neither!&rdquo; cried Johnny, excitedly. &ldquo;The man who sees the other
      first wins out. That's wood-craft, an' brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw! What do you know about it, anyhow?&rdquo; demanded Lucas. &ldquo;If he can't
      shoot so good what chance has he got&mdash;if he misses the first try,
      what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What chance has he got! First chance, miss or no miss. If he can't see
      the other first, where the devil does his good shooting come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Wood Wright, belligerently. &ldquo;Any fool can <i>see</i>, but
      he can't <i>shoot</i>! An' it's as much luck as wood-craft, too, an' don't
      you forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first shot don't win, Johnny; not in a game like that, with all the
      dodging an' ducking,&rdquo; remarked Red. &ldquo;You can't put one where you want it
      when a feller's slipping around in the brush. It's the most that counts,
      an' the best shot gets in the most. I wouldn't want to have to stand up
      against Hoppy an' a short gun, not in that game; no, sir!&rdquo; and Red shook
      his head with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument waxed hot. With the exception of Hopalong, who sat silently
      watchful, every one spoke his opinion and repeated it without regard to
      the others. It appeared that in this game, the man with the strongest
      lungs would eventually win out, and each man tried to show his superiority
      in that line. Finally, above the uproar, Cowan's bellow was herd, and he
      kept it up until some notice was taken of it. &ldquo;Shut up! <i>Shut up</i>!
      For God's sake, <i>quit</i>! Never saw such a bunch of tinder&mdash;let
      somebody drop a cold, burned-out match in this gang, an' hell's to pay.
      Here, <i>all</i> of you, play cards an' forget about cross-tag in the
      scrub. You'll be arguing about playing marbles in the dark purty soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; muttered Johnny, &ldquo;but just the same, the man who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about the man who! Did you hear <i>me</i>?&rdquo; yelled Cowan,
      swiftly reaching for a bucket of water. &ldquo;<i>This</i> is a game where <i>I</i>
      gets the most in, an' don't forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on; play cards,&rdquo; growled Lucas, who did not relish having his
      decision questioned on his own story. Undoubtedly somewhere in the wide,
      wide world there was such a thing as common courtesy, but none of it had
      ever strayed onto that range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairs scraped on the rough floor as the men pulled up to a table. &ldquo;I
      don't care a hang,&rdquo; came Elkins' final comment as he shuffled the cards
      with careful attention. &ldquo;I'm not any fancy Colt expert, but I'm damned if
      I won't take a chance in that game with any man as totes a gun.
      Leastawise, of <i>course</i>, I wouldn't take no such advantage of a lame
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect would have been ludicrous but for its deadly significance.
      Cowan, stooping to go under the bar, remained in that hunched-up attitude,
      his every faculty concentrated in his ears; the match on its way to the
      cigarette between Red's lips was held until it burned his fingers, when it
      was dropped from mere reflex action, the hand still stiffly aloft; Lucas,
      half in and half out of his chair, seemed to have got just where he
      intended, making no effort to seat himself. Skinny Thompson, his hand on
      his gun, seemed paralyzed; his mouth was open to frame a reply that never
      was uttered and he stared through narrowed eyelids at the blunderer. The
      sole movement in the room was the slow rising of Hopalong and the markedly
      innocent shuffling of the cards by Elkins, who appeared to be entirely
      ignorant of the weight and effect of his words. He dropped the pack for
      the cut and then looked up and around as if surprised by the silence and
      the expressions he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong stood facing him, leaning over with both hands on the table. His
      voice, when he spoke, rumbled up from his chest in a low growl. &ldquo;You won't
      <i>have</i> no advantage, Elkins. Take it from me, you've had yore last
      fling. I'm glad you made it plain, this time, so it's something I can take
      hold of.&rdquo; He straightened slowly and walked to the door, and an audible
      sigh sounded through the room as it was realized that trouble was not
      immediately imminent. At the door he paused and turned back around,
      looking back over his shoulder. &ldquo;At noon to-morrow I'm going to hoof it
      north through the brush between the river an' the river trail, starting at
      the old ford a mile down the river.&rdquo; He waited expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too&mdash;only the other way,&rdquo; was the instant rejoinder. &ldquo;Have it
      yore own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong nodded and the closing door shut him out into the night. Without
      a word the Bar-20 men arose and followed him, the only hesitant being
      Johnny, who was torn between loyalty and new-found friendship; but with a
      sorrowful shake of the head, he turned away and passed out, not far behind
      the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clannish, ain't they?&rdquo; remarked Elkins, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those remaining were regarding him sternly, questioningly, Cowan with a
      deep frown darkening his face. &ldquo;You hadn't ought to 'a' said that,
      Elkins.&rdquo; The reproof was almost an accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elkins looked steadily at the speaker. &ldquo;You hadn't ought to 'a' let me say
      it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;How did I know he was so touchy?&rdquo; His gaze left Cowan
      and lingered in turn on each of the others. &ldquo;Some of you ought to 'a' told
      me. I wouldn't 'a' said it only for what I said just before, an' I didn't
      want him to think I was challenging him to no duel in the brush. So I says
      so, an' then he goes an' takes it up that I <i>am</i> challenging him. I
      ain't got no call to fight with nobody. Ain't I tried to keep out of
      trouble with him ever since I've been here? Ain't I kept out of the poker
      games on his account? Ain't I?&rdquo; The grave, even tones were dispassionate,
      without a trace of animus and serenely sure of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces around him cleared gradually and heads began to nod in
      comprehending consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon you have,&rdquo; agreed Cowan, slowly, but the frown was not
      entirely gone. &ldquo;Yes, I reckon&mdash;mebby&mdash;you have.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MASTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was noon by the sun when Hopalong and Red shook hands south of the old
      ford and the former turned to enter the brush. Hopalong was cool and
      ominously calm while his companion was the opposite. Red was frankly
      suspicious of the whole affair and nursed the private opinion that Mr.
      Elkins would lay in ambush and shoot his enemy down like a dog. And Red
      had promised himself a dozen times that he would study the signs around
      the scene of action if Hopalong should not come back, and take a keen
      delight, if warranted, in shooting Mr. Elkins full of holes with no regard
      for an even break. He was thinking the matter over as his friend breasted
      the first line of brush and could not refrain from giving a slight
      warning. &ldquo;Get him, Hoppy,&rdquo; he called, earnestly; &ldquo;get him good. Let <i>him</i>
      do some of the moving about. I'll be here waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong smiled in reply and sprang forward, the leaves and branches
      quickly shutting him from Red's sight. He had worked out his plan of
      action the night before when he was alone and the world was still, and as
      soon as he had it to his satisfaction he had dropped off to sleep as
      easily as a child&mdash;it took more than gun-play to disturb his nerves.
      He glanced about him to make sure of his bearings and then struck on a
      curving line for the river. The first hundred yards were covered with
      speed and then he began to move more slowly and with greater regard for
      caution, keeping close to the earth and showing a marked preference for
      low ground. Sky-lines were all right in times of peace, but under the
      present conditions they promised to become unhealthy. His eyes and ears
      told him nothing for a quarter of an hour, and then he suddenly stopped
      short and crouched as he saw the plain trail of a man crossing his own
      direction at a right angle. From the bottom of one of the heel prints a
      crushed leaf was slowly rising back towards its original position, telling
      him how new the trail was; and as if this were not enough for his trained
      mind he heard a twig snap sharply as he glanced along the line of prints.
      It sounded very close, and he dropped instantly to one knee and thought
      quickly. Why had the other left so plain a trail, why had he reached up
      and broken twigs that projected above his head as he passed? Why had he
      kicked aside a small stone, leaving a patch of moist, bleached grass to
      tell where it had lain? Elkins had stumbled here, but there were no toe
      marks to tell of it. Hopalong would not track, for he was no assassin; but
      he knew that he would do if he were, and careless. The answer leaped to
      his suspicious mind like a flash, and he did not care to waste any time in
      trying to determine whether or not Elkins was capable of such a trick. He
      acted on the presumption that the trail had been made plain for a good
      reason, and that not far ahead at some suitable place,&mdash;and there
      were any number of such within a hundred yards,&mdash;the maker of the
      plain trail lay in wait. Smiling savagely he worked backward and turning,
      struck off in a circle. He had no compunctions whatever now about shooting
      the other player of the game. It was not long before he came upon the same
      trail again and he started another circle. A bullet <i>zipped</i> past his
      ear and cut a twig not two inches from his head. He fired at the smoke as
      he dropped, and then wriggled rapidly backward, keeping as flat to the
      earth as he could. Elkins had taken up his position in a thicket which
      stood in the centre of a level patch of sand in the old bed of the river,&mdash;the
      bed it had used five years before and forsaken at the time of the big
      flood when it cut itself a new channel and made the U-bend which now
      surrounded this piece of land on three sides. Even now, during the rainy
      season, the thicket which sheltered Mr. Elkins was frequently an island in
      a sluggish, shallow overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hole up, blast you!&rdquo; jeered Hopalong, hugging the ground. The second
      bullet from Mr. Elkins' gun cut another twig, this one just over his head,
      and he laughed insolently. &ldquo;I ain't ascared to do the moving, even if you
      are. Judging from the way you keep out o' sight the canned oysters are in
      the can again. <i>I</i> never did no ambushing, you coyote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't make remarks like that an' get away with 'em&mdash;I've knowed
      you too long,&rdquo; retorted Elkins, shifting quickly, and none too soon. &ldquo;You
      went an' got Slim afore he was wide awake. I know <i>you</i>, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong's surprise was but momentary, and his mind raced back over the
      years. Who was this man Elkins, that he knew Slim Travennes? &ldquo;Yo're a
      liar, Elkins, an' so was the man who told you that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Ewalt,&rdquo; jeered the other, nastily. &ldquo;Nobody'll hear it, an' you'll
      not live to tell it. Ewalt, Tex Ewalt; call me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've come back after all this time to make me get you, have you?
      Well, I ain't a-going to shoot no buttons off you <i>this</i> time. I
      allus reckoned you learned something at Muddy Wells&mdash;but you'll learn
      it here,&rdquo; Hopalong rejoined, sliding into a depression, and working with
      great caution towards the dry river bed, where fallen trees and hillocks
      of sand provided good cover in plenty. Everything was clear now and
      despite the seriousness of the situation he could not repress a smile as
      he remembered vividly that day at the carnival when Tex Ewalt came to town
      with the determination to kill him and show him up as an imitation. His
      grievance against Elkins was petty when compared to that against Ewalt,
      and he began to force the issue. As he peered over a stranded log he
      caught sight of his enemy disappearing into another part of the thicket,
      and two of his three shots went home. Elkins groaned with pain and fear as
      he realized that his right knee-cap was broken and would make him slow in
      his movements. He was lamed for life, even if he did come out of the duel
      alive; lamed in the same way that Hopalong was&mdash;the affliction he had
      made cruel sport of had come to him. But he had plenty of courage and he
      returned the fire with remarkable quickness, his two shots sounding almost
      as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong wiped the blood from his cheek and wormed his way to a new place;
      when half way there he called out again, &ldquo;How's yore health&mdash;Tex?&rdquo; in
      mock sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elkins lied manfully and when he looked to get in another shot his enemy
      was on the farther bank, moving up to get behind him. He did not know
      Hopalong's new position until he raised his head to glance down over the
      dried river bed, and was informed by a bullet that nicked his ear. As he
      ducked, another grazed his head, the third going wild. He hazarded a
      return shot, and heard Hopalong's laugh ring out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the story Lucas told, the best shot is going to win out this time,
      too,&rdquo; the Bar-20 man remarked, grimly. &ldquo;You thought a game like this would
      give you some chance against a better shot, didn't you? You are a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't over yet, not by a damned sight!&rdquo; came the retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you thought you had a little the best of it if you stayed still an'
      let me do the moving, didn't you? You'll learn something before I get
      through with you: but it'll be too late to do you any good,&rdquo; Hopalong
      called, crouched below a hillock of sand so the other could not take
      advantage of the words and single him out for a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't learn me nothing, you assassin; I've got my eyes open, this
      time.&rdquo; He knew that he had had them open before, and that Hopalong was in
      no way an assassin; but if he could enrage his enemy and sting him into
      some reflex carelessness he might have the last laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elkins' retort was wasted, for the sudden and unusual, although a familiar
      sound, had caught Hopalong's ear and he was giving all his attention to
      it. While he weighed it, his incredulity holding back the decision his
      common sense was striving to give him, the noise grew louder rapidly and
      common sense won out in a cry of warning an instant before a five-foot
      wall of brown water burst upon his sight, sweeping swiftly down the old,
      dry river bed; and behind it towered another and greater wall. Tree trunks
      were dancing end over end in it as if they were straws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cloud-burst!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Run, Tex! Run for yore life! Cloud-burst up the
      valley! Run, you fool; <i>Run</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tex's sarcastic retort was cut short as he instinctively glanced north,
      and his agonized curse lashed Hopalong forward. &ldquo;Can't run&mdash;knee
      cap's busted! Can't swim, can't do&mdash;ah, hell&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopalong saw him torn from his shelter and whisked down the raging torrent
      like an arrow from a bow. The Bar-20 puncher leaped from the bank, shot
      under the yellow flood and arose, gasping and choking many yards
      downstream, fighting madly to get the muddy water out of his throat and
      eyes. As he struck out with all his strength down the current, he caught
      sight of Tex being torn from a jutting tree limb, and he shouted
      encouragement and swam all the harder, if such a thing were possible.
      Tex's course was checked for a moment by a boiling back-current and as he
      again felt the pull of the rushing stream Hopalong's hand gripped his
      collar and the fight for safety began. Whirled against logs and stumps,
      drawn down by the weight of his clothes and the frantic efforts of Tex to
      grasp him&mdash;fighting the water and the man he was trying to save at
      the same time, his head under water as often as it was out of it, and
      Tex's vise-like fingers threatening him&mdash;he headed for the west shore
      against powerful cross-currents that made his efforts seem useless. He
      seemed to get the worst of every break. Once, when caught by a friendly
      current, they were swung under an overhanging branch, but as Hopalong's
      hand shot up to grasp it a submerged bush caught his feet and pulled him
      under, and Tex's steel-like arms around his throat almost suffocated him
      before he managed to beat the other into insensibility and break the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you go!&rdquo; he threatened; but his hand grasped the other's collar
      all the tighter and his fighting jaw was set with greater determination
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shot out into the main stream, where the U-bend channel joined the
      short-cut, and it looked miles wide to the exhausted puncher. He was
      fighting only on his will now. He would not give up, though he scarce
      could lift an arm, and his lungs seemed on fire. He did not know whether
      Tex was dead or alive, but he would get the body ashore with him, or go
      down trying. He bumped into a log and instinctively grasped it. It turned,
      and when he came up again it was bobbing five feet ahead of him. Ages
      seemed to pass before he flung his numb arm over it and floated with it.
      He was not alone in the flood; a coyote was pushing steadily across his
      path towards the nearer bank, and on a gliding tree trunk crouched a
      frightened cougar, its ears flattened and its sharp claws dug solidly
      through the bark. Here and there were cattle and a snake wriggled smoothly
      past him, apparently as much at home in the water as out of it. The log
      turned again and he just managed to catch hold of it as he came up for the
      second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were growing black before his eyes and strange, weird ideas and
      images floated through his brain. When he regained some part of his senses
      he saw ahead of him a long, curling crest of yellow water and foam, and he
      knew, vaguely, that it was pouring over a bar. The next instant his feet
      struck bottom and he fought his way blindly and slowly, with the stubborn
      determination of his kind, towards the brush-covered point twenty feet
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes and looked around he became conscious of
      excruciating pains and he closed them again to rest. His outflung hand
      struck something that made him look around again, and he saw Tex Ewalt,
      face down at his side. He released his grasp on the other's collar and
      slowly the whole thing came to him, and then the necessity for action,
      unless he wished to lose what he had fought so hard to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything short of the iron man Tex had become would have been dead before
      this or have been finished by the mauling he now got from Hopalong. But
      Tex groaned, gurgled a curse, and finally opened his eyes upon his
      rescuer, who sank back with a grunt of satisfaction. Slowly his
      intelligence returned as he looked steadily into Hopalong's eyes, and with
      it came the realization of a strange truth: he did not hate this man at
      all. Months of right living, days and nights of honest labor shoulder to
      shoulder with men who respected him for his ability and accepted him as
      one of themselves, had made a new man of him, although the legacy of
      hatred from the old Tex had disguised him from himself until now; but the
      new Tex, battered, shot-up, nearly drowned, looked at his old enemy and
      saw him for the man he really was. He smiled faintly and reached out his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassidy, yo're the boss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook.
    </p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
